            <abstract>
                <p>A man who desired the heavenly kingdom decided to become a monk and serve as Gabra Maryam’s disciple. But by the time he reached Dabra Alegwien, Gabra Maryam had died. Though saddened, the man still became a monk at that monastery. Sometime later, this same man was spirited away to the cathedral at Aksum. There, Gabra Maryam appeared to him in a luminous robe and led him to the veranda, where Mary stood blessing the clergy. The man watched as angels crowned Gabra Maryam. Then the angels placed a headband on the monk’s head and marched him outside the church before returning him to Alegwien.</p>

             <ab>A miracle performed by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer and blessings be with her servant Gabra Kidan forever and ever. Amen.
Listen to this miracle and wonder Our Lady performed for the blessed Gabra Maryam, the black pearl.
There was a man who desired the heavenly kingdom. He was peaceful with everyone. He was of good character and good deeds. When he was in a faraway country, he said to himself, “What good does this world and all its happiness do for me? For it destroys those who love it. I shall go to Our Father Gabra Maryam to be tonsured as a monk, and I will be his disciple.”
He said this and he began his journey to Our Blessed Father Gabra Maryam.
He suffered many troubles (such as hunger, thirst, and severe illness) on the road. He [finally], reached Dabra Alegwien1 after Our Father Gabra Maryam passed away.
The young man paid homage to Our Father Gabra Maryam’s tomb [by] weeping and falling on the ground, saying, “I came from a faraway place seeking your holiness. Please, be my helper!”
The young man, then, became a monk. He became vigilant in the spiritual battle.
[He later] said, “One day I was taken [in the spirit] to Aksum, the mother of cities. I entered the banquet where the nobility were eating. The nobility said to me, ‘Come. Eat with us!’ I wanted to eat with them. But [immediately] the blessed Gabra Maryam came to me wearing an indescribably luminous robe, and he said to me, ‘Do not sit at the nobilities’ banquet!’ He then held my hand and took me to the church. He brought me to the veranda, where the clergy were [sitting], after church service.”
(For it is their custom to sit by the Holy Aksum Cathedral’s veranda [for a while] after performing the Divine Liturgy or the Divine Office. After sitting for a while, they will go home.)
The monk continued: “When I reached the veranda, I saw Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, blessing the clergy by her hand. On every holiday and every Sunday, many people will come and stand around the church like pomegranate seeds. They stand before Our Lady Mary and rejoice in listening to many of her miracles and the Queen’s pure words.2
“[I then saw] angels bringing a crown of light and a royal headband to Our Father. They [the angels and Gabra Maryam] adorned me [with the crown and the royal headband], proclaiming, ‘Come and see the embellishment for the son of Gabra Maryam, God’s beloved!’ Then they [the angels and Gabra Maryam] took me outside the church like a bedecked bridegroom. Many people were following me and clamoring in happiness.”
Then they returned him back to his monastery named Alegwien. We didn’t mention his name here to avoid vainglory, since he is still alive.
My dear Lady Mary, as you blessed your children, bless me, your servant Gabra Kidan, forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
