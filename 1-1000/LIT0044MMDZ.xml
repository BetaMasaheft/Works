            <abstract>
                <p>A deacon in the town of Babba faithfully served Mary in the church. Satan envied this deacon and inspired the people of Babba to complain that he ate and drank with a blacksmith. When the local ruler confronted the deacon with this charge, the deacon insisted that Mary’s love was his only food and drink. But his accusers went before the ruler once more, as as they again bore false witness, an angel of the Lord appeared and struck them down. The local ruler prostrated before the deacon as the townspeople marveled at this sign.</p>

                <note>Translated by Mehari Worku with Wendy Laura Belcher. <ref type="mss" corresp="EMDA10">EMDA (HMML) 10, s. 218b </ref>, in 2022. </note>
             <ab>The miracle [performed] by Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, the Mother of God, may her prayers and blessings be with her female servant Eleni, forever and ever, amen.
A deacon in the town of Babba served [in the church] with all his power, as much as he was able, whether in [burning] incense or other offerings, or in lighting [candles] at all hours. Everything he did pleased Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, the Mother of God.
Satan envied this deacon, so [he acted and] the people of the town rose up against this deacon. They evilly plotted together to blackmail him.
They said [to each other], “This deacon eats and drinks with a blacksmith!”
They accused the deacon, telling this [lie] to the local ruler, [claiming that it was] because they loved and honored the name of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, the Mother of God.
A council was then held with the local ruler.
The local ruler summoned the deacon and said to him “What are you doing? Is it true what they say that you eat and drink with a blacksmith?”
The deacon replied, “As for me, my [only] food and drink is the love of the Virgin Mary.”
The local ruler ordered that the accusers be brought to tell him how the deacon ate and drank. So, they were brought to speak before the local ruler.
There, they [lied again and] gave false witness.
Before they had even finished their speech, the angel of the Lord came and struck them down [so that] they died.
The local ruler became terrified. He [reverently] fell at the deacon’s feet.
The townspeople were also amazed by this sign and wonder, thanking the Lord and praising Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, the Mother of God.
May her prayers and blessings be with her female servant Kola Dǝngǝl forever and forever. Amen.
