            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>When the monks of Dabra Zamaddo fled to other countries, they brought the monastery’s icon of Mary with them and left it in the city of Ruha. Before they left, they also took as many of the monastery’s books as they could carry and stashed them in a cave, the entrance to which was adjacent to the shrine. This cave was perpetually wet, since spring water seeped in from above and dripped down the cavern’s sides. Despite sitting in this wet cave for fifty years, and despite being made of parchment and ink, the books remained miraculously intact, thanks to Mary’s intervention.</p>

                <ab>When it was the time of the persecution, the people of the monastery left, carrying a few of (the monastery’s) books, as many as they were able to carry, and went to other countries; nothing is known about their status. But they left her icon in the city of Ruha, alone; no one stayed (with it) to keep it. As for the numerous and heavy books, they left them at the mouth of the cell, outside the shrine, which is on the left as one enters the shrine. Listen, my brothers, to the news the like of which has not been heard before this time! And see the power of the miracle of Our Lady Mary and her amazing deeds that have not been seen before, if you find the mind to know and evaluate her wisdom, to pursue her love manifested in the many kinds of salvation of Our Lady Mary! The cave, which we said they put the books in, is not dry but is a spring of water; also (water) comes down on it from above; and it drips from its side in all directions. The cave in which the books had been is not dry even during the season of hagay, to say nothing of the season of Kramt. What does this thing look like – the presence of ink and parchment in the middle of water for about 50 years? Lest our minds doubt and we think the story looks like a lie, behold, here are the books called Sinodos, Qalemǝntos, Matshafa Bǝrhan, and Matshafa Mǝstir, whose brightness looks like the stars of the sky. There are also many others that were found with them. We also see the cave always dripping water like the sky during the season of Kramt. What do the story and deeds of this miracle look like? It has not been heard before – ink and parchment living in water, with the color of the parchment not spoilt or changed, and the letters not mixed with its pair! This miracle which Our Lady Mary worked at Dabra Zamaddo is strange. If we hear the Holy Scriptures, (they tell us) that formerly Moses divided the Red Sea with his stick and put it asunder, (and the same) Scriptures tell us that the children of Israel passed on dry land. They do not tell us that they lived in the water. If it was God’s will, they would have lived in the water, but God forbid. God (wants) it to be known that he saves people in different ways. Therefore, he let them pass on dry land and brought them where they ought to settle, because their settlement was elsewhere. But the Red Sea he prepared and made the final settlement of the Egyptians. Let us come back to the case of the books about which we said were in the water, and leave the story of the Hebrews, for our interest is not in the Hebrews but in Our Lady Mary who worked this miracle for the sake of the salvation of man. (She will save) anyone, if his heart is firm in trust in her, saying, “She will save me, too, as she saved the property of her house from the destructive water”. If anyone says so and his heart is firm, Our Lady Mary, who does all this, has no interest other than in the salvation of man. (That is why) she made the water flee and made it run hither and thither. Furthermore, she made it not spoil her books until the time of tribulation was over, (which was) about 50 years. For God was angry with the Christians and (so) authorized the Arami to occupy (Ethiopia). Furthermore, let us return to what Our Lady Mary did: Regarding the people who lived in (the monastery) but were not restricted by the rules of her (house), she scattered them to other countries. Had they been restricted by her rules, she would have preserved them together with her books, as God had preserved Baruch and Abimelech who lived observing his law when the Children of Israel, who committed too much lawlessness, were taken into captivity. In regards to the people of Our Lady Mary’s household, too, she did not let them remain in her house before, but expelled them and dismissed them to wherever they wanted. We do not know their end either. But us, O our brothers, let us pray to Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, lest she make us like them. May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever. Amen. </ab>
