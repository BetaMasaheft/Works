            <abstract>
                <p>Romanos was a wealthy man living in Alexandria who gave alms to the poor every Sunday. He became infatuated with a young woman and tried to persuade her to have sex with him, but she refused. When she returned home, her husband, desperate to get out of poverty, planned to secure a loan from Romanos and use the money for trade abroad. But his wife begged him not to do it, prophesying that if he did, his boat would sink. He went ahead anyway, and just as his wife had predicted, the boat he was on sank. He survived and returned to Alexandria, where he lived incognito as a beggar for two years. Meanwhile, Romanos forced the young woman to marry him. One day, when the young woman was giving out alms at the church, she saw her husband. She went home and told Romanos, who retrieved John and dressed him in elegant clothing. Romanos then confessed his sins before the archbishop and bequeathed all his riches to John and his wife. A year later, an angel appeared to the archbishop and said Romanos would one day come to him. On that day, the archbishop was to make him a monk. Romanos would then climb the pillar of Simon the Stylites and remain there for twelve years, healing the sick. All this came to pass</p>
