                <note>Translated by Jeremy Brown & Dawit Muluneh with Wendy Laura Belcher <ref type="mss" corresp="ESPQQM004">ESP (UH) QQM-004, s. 130b, in 2022. </note>
             <ab>A miracle [performed] by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, may her prayers and her blessings and the mercy of her beloved son be with her servant Walda Yohannes forever and ever, amen.
What follows is what happened [regarding fire and incense] in a certain town.
A certain man made a vow to her[, that is, Our Lady Mary,] giving her incense when he had it.
One day, a fire arose in the house of that man.
The fire rose up and burned all his possessions. Nothing remained. Only the incense was saved by the power of Our Lady Mary[, since it belonged to her].
He walked out with his uncharred box of incense, which looked [undamaged,] as though it had been sitting in a new house.
Having heard about this, the Christian people marveled at the power of Our Lady Mary.
A different day [in that same town], while the clergy were performing the mass, a priest came out to [swing the censer and] incense [the church].
When the clergy arrived at the icon of Our Holy Lady Mary, the Twofold Virgin, a deacon stood in front of it and lit a candle.
But that lit candle [set a fire that] burned all the way up the curtains to the church ceiling.
However, while the clergy were staring at it, the fire went out due to the power of Our Lady.
May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with us forever and ever, amen.</ab>
