             <ab>A miracle performed by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer and blessings be with her servant Gabra Kidan forever and ever. Amen.
Our blessed father, the black pearl [?], Gabra Maryam, said, “One day my Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, the Universal Queen, came to me and said, ‘My dear beloved Gabra Maryam, come [and] let me take you to my sanctuary [in] Aksum so you might be able to greet it.’”
She then instantly took him to Aksum in body and soul. When she brought him to Aksum, [she took him] to the gate-keeper, which is the dining room [?].
Our blessed father, Gabra Maryam, saw many people between the veranda [of the church] and the fence. The people were bound.
Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, said, “By whose command are these people of my household bound?”
Our Lady and Our Salvation added, “I command to release them [immediately]!”
[Immediately,] all those numerous people were released.
Then, Our Queen entered the sanctuary holding her servant Gabra Maryam. The angels were praising her.
The people who were released were saying, “Yes to your coming! For by your coming, Our dear Salvation and Our Queen, we have received great joy and are released from our bonds!”
The Virgin said to Gabra Maryam, “My dear beloved Gabra Maryam, are you seeing this great mystery? I do this all the time. Not a day passes without me visiting Aksum cathedral and my servants who live in it.”
Having said this, she bid him [farewell], and he returned to his monastery, glorifying the Lord and praising Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God.
               My dear Pure Lady, who is like a wise bee, clothe me with the flowers from Nisan,1
               Deliver me from the sickness of sin and [keep me from] withering away.
               Let us rejoice with you in the New World, like a satisfied ram.
               To those who call out to you, be the forgiver of their sins,
               Ceaselessly, forever and ever, amen.
May the prayer and blessings of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, be with her servant Gabra Kidan forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
