            <abstract>
                <p>Romanos was a wealthy man living in Alexandria who gave alms to the poor every Sunday. He became infatuated with a young woman and tried to persuade her to have sex with him, but she refused. When she returned home, her husband, desperate to get out of poverty, planned to secure a loan from Romanos and use the money for trade abroad. But his wife begged him not to do it, prophesying that if he did, his boat would sink. He went ahead anyway, and just as his wife had predicted, the boat he was on sank. He survived and returned to Alexandria, where he lived incognito as a beggar for two years. Meanwhile, Romanos forced the young woman to marry him. One day, when the young woman was giving out alms at the church, she saw her husband. She went home and told Romanos, who retrieved John and dressed him in elegant clothing. Romanos then confessed his sins before the archbishop and bequeathed all his riches to John and his wife. A year later, an angel appeared to the archbishop and said Romanos would one day come to him. On that day, the archbishop was to make him a monk. Romanos would then climb the pillar of Simon the Stylites and remain there for twelve years, healing the sick. All this came to pass.</p>

             <ab>A miracle performed by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer and blessings be with our king, Yohannes, and our queen, Sabla Wongel, forever and ever. Amen.
In Alexandria there was a man named Romanos. He was very rich. He had a lot of gold and silver, countless accoutrements, many vineyards, plenty of gardens, and a multitude of camels, cattle, sheep and goats. No one was able to count the amount of gold and silver he had.
Romanos was compassionate to all people. Particularly, every week on the holy Sunday he sits by the gates of a church giving alms in the name of Our Lady Mary and the Resurrection of her beloved son.
[Seeing Romanos’s works of mercy,] Satan, the enemy of goodness, envied him. One day, Romanos went to church to pray as usual. It was the Church of Saint Esdros. As he was exiting the church, he suddenly saw a beautiful young woman. Immediately, his heart was completely enamored of her. He began to contemplate her beauty. She was so attractive.
He asked her, “Who are you? Where do you live?”
She replied, “What kind of question is this?” [But in her heart], she was also thinking about his beauty and the adornment of his apparel. She was saying to herself, “How is it that such a handsome man is speaking to me?”
She said to him, “Is there anything I can help you with, sir?”
He replied, “I would like to make my heart happy1 and [ask you to] allow me to sleep with you.”
The young woman said in humility, “Sir, I am a poor and wretched young woman. And I don’t belong to you at all.”
Romanos said, “If you do what I am asking you, I will give you a lot of honor. You will be revered by everyone in this town.”
The young woman replied, “Trust me, sir. I have never slept with anyone except with my husband. Who is tricking you to cheat on your wife?”
He said, “But we did not plan this. And many people in this world do it every day. Just because I haven’t done it yet, don’t think that I can’t do what I want, whether you like it or not.”
He wanted to take her by force.
The young woman said, “Sir, please let me tell you one thing!”
He replied, “Go ahead. I will do whatever you want. Tell me.”
The young woman continued, “I think you are that person named Romanos, the fame of whose good works to all people has filled all places like the sweet aroma of incense. Right?”
Romanos replied, “Yes, that is me.”
The young woman said, “If you are that Romanos, whose sweet incense offering has risen to the throne of the Lord and filled all the earth, [then] who planted this wicked thought in your heart?”
When he noticed that she was not going to consent, he left her and went away [for the time being]. He kept sending his servants to convince her, but they couldn’t. [Seeing his servants’ inability to convince her,] he himself also began to come and promise her riches. She refused.
One day her husband said to her, “How can I allow myself to see you, a beautiful and adorable woman, in such poverty and indigence? Now, I will go to the rich Romanos to borrow gold. I will work with it [and make some profit to alleviate our poverty]. Seeing you in poverty burns my flesh!”
His wife replied, “My dear brother, don’t you know that wealth and poverty are in God’s hands? Please, don’t go to Romanos, for last night I had a dream. In the dream, I was in Romanos’ house as his wife. My dear brother, the world and everything in it passes away. Let us live in our poverty, [instead of] sinning before the Lord. Let what you earn by the work of your hand (which is cutting trees) be enough for you. It will be enough for us to sustain ourselves until the Lord shows his mercy upon us. If you borrow gold from Romanos and go for trade, your boat will sink in the sea and your money will be lost. Then Romanos will come, take me by force, and make me his wife. Beware! I have told you already!”
The husband refused to listen to her words. He went to Romanos and borrowed gold dinar. He bought some materials with it, rented a boat, and went for trade. It was May.
A wind rose and disturbed the sea. It destroyed the boat and all the people in it. That lumberjack survived by climbing on a slab [of wood]. By the will of the Lord, the waves brought him to a shore. He sat down weeping.
Travelers saw him and asked him about why he was crying. He told them everything that happened to him. But he did not tell them that he was from Alexandria. Instead, he said to them, “It has been sixteen days since I ate food and drank water.”
When they heard his story, the people wept very much. They gave the man bread and water to nourish himself. They took away the dress he was wearing and gave him another garment. They traded the slab he floated on with an iron bow. Then they said farewell and continued their journey.
In the evening, the man changed his clothes in order not to be known and went to the fourth entrance of St. Abu Qir, the True Healer of the Sick, where there was a place for travelers. He entered one of the small lodges to beg for alms from those who come and go to the place. He did not reveal himself to anyone, not even for his wife, for two years.
After two years, Alexandrian ships came back to the town and told the wife of John the lumberjack that her husband had arrived. She thought the news was true. So, she put on beautiful clothes and went to [the port].
When she reached the house of the captain, she found him with many people who were consoling him for the sunken ship. She asked him about her husband. He replied, “My dear Lady, we suffered a great calamity. When the boat sank, many people perished. None of us knew where our fellows drifted away. I survived [by] boarding another boat that was passing by me. I have no idea if anyone on the boat survived or not.”
The wife was shocked by what she heard from the captain. She went home weeping.
When the rich Romanos heard the news that her husband John the lumberjack was lost, he sent his servants. The servants snatched her from amidst mourners and made her Romanos’s wife by force. He adorned her with expensive clothes that amazed everyone in the town. When she went to church on Sundays, she gave alms. Romanos too kept giving alms to the poor, as was his custom.
[One day,] on the twelfth of Hedar, the feast of the archangel St. Michael, the woman went with her servants to church. As she was giving alms, she saw her husband receiving alms from her hand with other beggars. She was shocked! She returned home crying.
She told Romanos all that happened, how she saw her husband receiving alms with beggars.
When Romanos saw her in such tears, his heart trembled with the fear of the Lord. He went to where her husband was, grabbed his hand, and brought him to his house.
When his wife saw Romanos holding her husband’s hand and dragging him, she thought that he was [going] to kill him. Her husband, John the lumberjack, also was afraid like her. That day was the feast of St. Mina the Martyr.
Romanos gathered the archbishop and all the town’s nobility and prepared a banquet for them. They ate their fill and blessed Romanos, saying, “May the Lord give you longevity to commemorate Mina the Martyr!”
When they were about to leave, Romanos said, “Please, wait!” Then, he ordered [his servants] to bring John the lumberjack before the archbishop. Romanos made John the lumberjack dress in expensively adorned clothes; he wore a golden belt and put a golden ring on his finger. Romanos also made John the lumberjack’s wife stand before the archbishop.
Then Romanos said, “My lord archbishop, the governor, and all you venerable people, let me tell you what was hidden in my heart. This man you see before you is the husband of this young woman. I took her without her consent. I wanted to live in sin. Now, please be my witnesses, I hereby give my house, all my property, and all my male and female servants to him. Let him and his wife own them. I am doing this for the Lord’s love and the love of Our Lady Mary Mariham.”
When the archbishop heard this, he became sad and said, “Who is going to take care of the poor like you?”
Romanos replied, “My dear father, it is the Lord who takes care of the poor.” Having said this, he left.
The archbishop and all the people followed him to the seashore. He prayed for about three hours. Then he said, “My dear Lady Mary, into your hands I commit my life!” He jumped into the sea before everyone and disappeared from their eyes.
After a year the archangel appeared to Archbishop Abba Yolyanos, saying, “Don’t be sad about Romanos, [thinking] he drowned in the sea. For I received him and took him to an island. He is still alive, enjoying leisure, reading holy books, and praising the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. He will come to you.”
[The archangel continued:] “When he comes, lay your hands on him and tonsure him to be a monk. Take him to the pillar of Simon the Stylites to stay there for a little while. After spending twelve years on the pillar, he will go to eternal life.
“A word has come from the Lord saying, ‘Dear Romanos, all the alms that you have given since your childhood are annulled because you took another man’s wife while her husband was alive. Didn’t you know that a drop of gall ruins a lot of honey? But from now on, all that you have done, you will find it before my throne.’
“Do not reveal this secret to him until you see him face to face.”
After saying this, the angel disappeared. In the second year, the Lord’s angel appeared to the archbishop [again], saying, “Romanos is standing before the church. Go and do what [you have been told].”
The archbishop went and found Romanos at the church’s gate. His body was emitting a sweet aroma. The archbishop embraced Romanos, took him into the church, and tonsured him as a monk.
He heard a voice saying, “Worthy! Worthy! Worthy! Romanos to the pure monastic habit!”
Then he climbed the pillar [of Simon the Stylites] and healed sick people. He then died and entered the heavenly kingdom through the prayer of Our Lady Mary, the Mother of God.
May her prayer and blessings be with our king, Yohannes, and our queen, Sabla Wongel, forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
