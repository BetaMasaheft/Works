            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>There was a monk named Bakwra Tseyon who planned to take hermitage with four other monks. These monks were familiar with a story that told of how Mary fled from Egypt and went to Ethiopia, where she stayed in a cell for seven months with her son and Joseph. Inspired by Mary, Bakwra Tseyon and the other monks planned to live in this same cell for five years. They had no food and no company, since the cell was in the desert. After five years of toil, the enemy (i.e., Satan) influenced some of the monks to consider leaving. But Bakwra Tseyon declared that he would wait in the cell until he received Mary’s blessing. The other monks set off into the desert. The next morning Mary appeared in the cell and told Bakwra Tseyon he must go to King Lalibala’s country, for his grave would be located there. He followed Mary’s instructions, and when he died he was buried in the church of Madhane ʿAlam. Meanwhile, the other monks searched the desert for a miracle, but in vain.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, revealed to a certain monk whose name was Bakwra tsǝyon, where he took hermitage with his four (spiritual) brothers: People claim that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had lived in the cell in which he took hermitage. (It is said that) when she fled from the cursed Herod, she (first) went to Egypt and from there she came to the country of Ethiopia and lived in that cell seven months with her beloved Son (and) with Joseph and Salome. When these (four) monks heard the history of this cell – that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had lived in it – they led their hermitage in it, to pray to her for the salvation of their souls. They lived in it five years, combating, in much toil and affliction, because there was no food in the cell. And the desert was (too) far from people. After they lived five years, (the enemy) incited the four monks, and caused them to think (of leaving). They said, “Let us tour the desert. If we find wayfarers, we shall ask them to bless us and comfort us regarding the concern in our heart”. But Bakwra tsǝyon strengthened his trust in Our Lady. He said, “I will not look for a blessing from others, but from Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. I will look for her blessing, if I (deserve to) find it. If not, I will die here”. He said this and remained alone. And they went to where they intended. Early next morning, as he was there alone, (Our Lady) came to him. She met him and comforted him concerning the sorrow in his heart. She said to him, “Go to the land of Lalibala, for the Creator has ordered your grave to be there”. She said this and ascended into (fol. 149r) the heavens. And the monk went to where she ordered him. He rested there and was buried by the church of Madhane ʿAlam. See, my brothers, how a person with two hearts and whose mind wavers, saying, “Would I get (what I want) or would I not”, will stay away from the hope in Our Lady and the mercy of Our Lord. The other monks were separated from finding her and seeing her because of the deficiency of their heart (manifested) in looking for a hope from others. But Bakwra tsǝyon, who strengthened his trust in Our Lady without doubt, earned Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, to the end. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
