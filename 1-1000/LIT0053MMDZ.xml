                <p>Three priests on Mount Sinai named Dawit, Yohannes, and Elias wrote a letter to a bishop in Jerusalem asking for Mary’s book, which was rumored to be with John the Evangelist. These priests believed that John did not die, and that he continued to live on earth and perform healing miracles. When the letter arrived in Jerusalem, the members of the church searched for the book, but they could not find it. Those in Jerusalem believed that John had been killed and that Mary’s book had been destroyed when a group of Jews entered the Temple. In their letter back to Mount Sinai, the people of Jerusalem reported hearing witnesses say that Mary’s book might reside with John the son of Zebedee in Ephesus, and that they would like a copy if possible. The priests then sent a letter to Ephesus, but the church was closed. Then, after putting incense into the center of the room, they prayed to Christ. Before their prayer had ended, John appeared before them with Mary’s book. The priests later copied the book and sent it to Jerusalem.</p>

             <ab>A miracle [performed] by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, may her prayer and blessing be upon her servant Waradaqal forever and ever, amen.
Three holy men served the Lord God in Mount Sinai, where the Lord revealed himself to Moses at the burning bush. They were called Priest Dawit, Priest Yohannes, and Deacon Elias. They were appointed to over 320 monasteries[, which were so numerous] because Mount Sinai was surrounded by the Lord’s glory.
The three holy men wrote a letter to Jerusalem’s assistant bishop, saying, “We would like to know about The Book of the News of Our Lady Mary. We have heard that John the younger, the beloved of his Lord [Christ], has the book. Just like Christ loved John, Our Lady Mary loved John as well. [We write now, centuries after Christ’s death, because] John did not die but is still on earth handing out God’s mercy to Christians and healing people from their diseases.”
When the three men’s letter arrived in the church [in Jerusalem] and was read aloud before the people, [the people there] began to search for the book. However, they couldn’t find it; the Jews had entered the temple and killed Patriarch James because he had said, “I am the brother of Our Lord.” [As they killed him], the Jews found the book in James’s hand and destroyed it.
On the twenty-ninth of Tahsas, [Christmas day,] the angels of heaven gathered, saying, “Glory to God [in the highest], who has exalted his mother. Peace on earth!” Also, cherubim were shouting, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord who loves humanity!”
[Before he died,] James said [to the apostles], “I have written The Book of the News of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Twofold Virgin, [and sent a copy] to John [the younger,] Christ’s beloved.” All the apostles were witnesses [to his writing of the book].
For this reason, the people in Jerusalem sent a message back to the three holy men at Mount Sinai. They wrote, “We didn’t find The Book of the News of Our Lady Mary. But we have found a [written] witness by James that The Book of the News of Our Holy Lady Mary, the Twofold Virgin, [does exist and] is in Ephesus with John [the younger, Christ’s beloved,] the son of Zebedee. If you find it, please send us a copy so that we might put to shame the Jews who crucified Christ.”
The three holy men carried a message [from Mount Sinai] to Ephesus. However, they found that the church was closed, [and John was not there].
So they began to pray, putting incense in the censer and saying, “Our Dear Lord Jesus Christ, who chose and loved John more than any of the other disciples, reveal [where he is] to us so that [we can ask him, and] he can come and tell us about The Book of the News of Your Mother.”
Before they even finished their prayer, John came to them. He said, “Don’t be sad, dear blessed brothers. May Our Lord Jesus Christ give you a good reward for your laborious and exhausting travel. Now, take The Book of the News of My Lord’s Mother and carry it to Mount Sinai. Say to the brothers [there for me], ‘Look, I am still alive! I haven’t died. I am waiting for my Lord’s return from heaven, for he told me, “You won't die until I come back.”’”
[Then John added,] “After reading this book, perform the commemoration of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Twofold Virgin.”
When the three holy men read that book [in Ephesus], a fragrant rain fell from heaven on all the people.
Afterward, the three holy men took the book to Mount Sinai. The people there received it with joy and gladness, praising the Lord. For he had revealed to them The Book of the News of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold-Virgin, the Mother of God[, which was written by James, the brother of Jesus].
Then, [as requested, they sent a copy of] the book to Jerusalem. May her two wings cover us, who also have relied on her prayer as a good shield. Forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
