            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>There was an abbot who devoted himself wholly to Mary. For his bed covering he used a goat skin, under which there was an infestation of bugs. The abbot was embarrassed by his situation and did not want to mention it to the other monks. So he prayed to Mary instead, asking her to send him birds to deal with his bug problem. Birds immediately appeared.</p>

                <ab>A miracle she worked for the holy fathers and pure brothers. One of them was their father and an abbot, devoted to practicing the acts of the saints. He never left the church of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, neither during the day nor the night. Worldly concern never crossed his mind. He never paid attention to food and drink either. And his cover was of goat-skin. As he lived devoted to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, bugs underneath his cover tormented him. He was embarrassed to show them (to others). At that time he called Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and said to her, “Bring me birds. No one else can deal with it”. At that moment, she brought him what he asked her and fulfilled his desire. See, our brothers, the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and her saying, “Yes” to anyone who one asks her. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
