                <p>A man who loved and devoted himself to Mary recounted a vision he had one night in which a man in a luminous robe appeared to him. This mysterious man gave the dreamer his gleaming white garment and told him to write down the miracles of Mary—presumably, on this very robe. When he woke up, the man immediately composed a prayer of praise for Mary.</p>

             <ab>This is a miracle of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer be with us forever and ever. Amen.
There was a man who loved Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. He observed her feasts. He read her praises and miracles unceasingly.
Once he said, “When I was thinking about composing a few praises for her miracles, a luminous man who was robed in light came to me in a vision at night. He was holding a beautiful and majestic luminous white robe. He then said to me, ‘Take this white robe and write the beautiful miracles of the Mother of God.’ After saying this, he disappeared from my sight. I woke up immediately and greatly rejoiced. I knew that Our Lady Mary, the Mother of God, wanted [me to compose praises of her miracles]. Then, I prayed in this composition saying:
               "I praise your grace, my dear Lady Mary.1
               I beg you to open my mouth,
               And to give eloquence to my tongue,
               That I might speak your beautiful miracles,
               Which make the sinner and the transgressor into a righteous one,
               That I might speak your miracles’ greatness,
               From the multitude of your miracles and the myriads of heard miracles,
               I tell to the multitude of your people only a few that are written down,
               By a drop of water as little as a palm,
               Your power saved the cannibal2 from judgment and damnation.
               When the rich man3 was accused by Satan the accuser
               Before your son the wise judge,
               Your power saved him with a bread crumb.
               When a man denied his faith4 and erred due to the wicked counsel of Satan,
               Your son saved him to make him his [mercy] sign.
               When the widow5 cried bitterly in prayer before your icon,
               Your son saved [her son] from hanging.
               Therefore, in order to be saved from death,
               We speak to you offering praises.
               May Mary’s prayer save us from her son’s wrath.
               My dear Lady, may your prayer and supplication be with your servant forever and ever. Amen."</ab>
