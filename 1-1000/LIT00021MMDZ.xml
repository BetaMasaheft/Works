            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>There was a group of loyal Christians who lived in Dabra Zamaddo. They knew of nothing except prayer and worship. Neither the men nor the women knew how to do any manual labor, and they would not search for food and clothes. They contemplated leaving at times, but they always agreed that it would be better for them to die in Dabra Zamaddo than to leave. Mary appreciated their determination and loyalty, so she called to them with her own voice. She told the people of Dabra Zamaddo that “both market places are not to be found,” and she repeated that phrase several times. The people of Dabra Zamaddo comprehended the meaning of the phrase. They embraced their poverty and fasted in Mary’s honor.</p>

                <ab>Listen, my brothers! Let us tell you the words of a miracle she caused the people of Dabra Zamaddo to hear and she comforted them: They lived in meekness; they did not recognize the bodily nature nor were they in servitude to it. They were not interested (in anything) but in prayer and repeated prostration in worship. The men, but few, never worked the farm field. Neither did the women know manual work, but were (devoted) only to prayer and repeated prostration in worship. The men as well as the women never toiled with their bodies in search of food and clothes. Therefore, want of the body tortured them for disregarding manual work. Our Lady saw their mind going up and down, in saying, “Should we (or should we not) leave this monastery and go where food for the body is found?” The mind of some said, “It is better for us to die here than leave our country”. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw the determination in their heart, she called them with her own voice from air at noon while everyone was hearing it. The voice called them, saying, “People of Zamaddo, people of Zamaddo”. And they replied, saying, “Now, speak out; we will hear you”. The voice said to them, “Both market places are not to be found – of the earth and of the heaven, delight of the body and life of the soul. Both market places are not to be found – interest in wealth of the body, accumulating worldly property, and being (spiritually) richer than all the poor, hoping in the mind to find the delight of the Kingdom of Heaven. Both market places are not to be found”. Her voice became silent after it said this. And the saints heard and understood the interpretation of what (the voice) said, “Both market places are not to be found”. They earned the Kingdom of Heaven with their poverty. They ignored eating and drinking for the sake of the love for Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Ǝlleni Nǝgǝst, forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
