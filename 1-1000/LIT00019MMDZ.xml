            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>During the period when Abbuna Sama Iyyasus served as the abbot of Dabra Zamaddo, it came to pass that the Arami declared war against the Christian regions of Wakat, Tatara, Maqdala, and the lowlands. When Abbuna Sama Iyyasus heard about this declaration, he prepared to fight back. He wielded his prayers like weapons: his prayer to God was his sword, and his prayer to Mary was his spear. He also made a covenant with Mary, which served as his shield. Between the months of Hedar and Magabit, Mary prevented disaster by dispersing the Arami soldiers. Even so, the Arami fighting spirit did not wane, and Mary eventually led the soldiers to the land of Adal. There the Arami were defeated; only twelve of their chiefs survived.</p>

                <ab>Another miracle that Our Lady Mary, who is Maryam in Hebrew, worked for Abuna tsama Iyyasus when the Arami counseled and gathered from many regions and camped at the land of Waga to lay waste the Christian regions of Wakat, tatara, the low land, and Maqdala. They counseled against these regions and made a (military) camp because the Arami have the tradition of laying regions waste whenever they change reign. This time, too, (they camped) because the one they called Dayyu Daba was appointed. The time for their tradition of devastation and attack is the month of hǝdar, on the feast day of Saint Michael, the Archangel. They lay (regions) waste at that time. When Abuna tsama Iyyasus heard that they had come together for this purpose, he rose up to fight (them), making the (prayer) Our Father his sword, with fruits of the olive tree, and making the Prayer of Our Lady Mary his spear. And he made the Covenant of Our Lady Mary his shield. Long before the Arami arrived to fight, he would fight (them) standing before the tabot of Our Lady Mary and Our Lord Jesus Christ day and night. As the Arami would set out to come to the direction of his country, he would hear and report to Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “How could you neglect your country, and deliver the sons of your household to the Arami?” At that time she would send the Arami back and disperse them, after they had set out to fight. They would go on doing so, with their heart never abandoning the fight, and (the people of the monastery) never resting (from watching). Whenever (Abuna tsama Iyyasus) would hear the news of the coming of the Arami, he would report to Our Lady Mary and she would return them and disperse them after they set out to fight. They went on so, starting in the month of hǝdar, until the month of Maggabit, with the Arami not resting nor giving respite to our father. When Our Lady Mary saw the determination of the Arami and their counsel to destroy her country, she drove them to the land of Adal when they did not suspect it. And there, she requited them the requital due to the evil. She let them fall in the hands of their enemy. None but one of their twelve chiefs came back. We do not know if, of their armies, one from each country had ever survived (to bring) the news. What is known is that they were wiped out. (This) was heard by everybody. See what Our Lady Mary works for her beloved ones! If there is one who puts his trust in her, she will work for him, too. To us, too, (she will do) likewise, if we put our trust in her. For she is not biased against anyone among those who put their trust in her. She would not say about one, “I love him”, and about the other, “I hate him”. And regarding Abuna tsama Iyyasus, the prayer he did, ten hundred Our Father, he had been doing (it) every day in the days of his sorrow. He defeated his enemies with this his prayer and his trust in Our Lady Mary. May the prayer and blessing of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, keep the wretched and weak Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
