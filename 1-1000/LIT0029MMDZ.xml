            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>In Semrata Ab there was a woman who loved Mary and worked at her church. The clergy gave this woman a support stick, which they called “the stick of the woman.” The woman wanted to go to the place of the saints to pray, and she asked Mary for a sign that she should go. The next day she found her stick outside the church. She asked those in the clergy if they had moved it, and they said they had not. It happened again the next day, and the clergy again said they had not moved it. The woman took a priest aside and told him about her desire to go to the place of the saints. He told her to take her stick and go where she intended. When the woman arrived there, Mary appeared to her. She said there were two distressed people in that country, and that the woman must tell them that Mary would mitigate their distress. The woman did as Mary instructed, but the two distressed people were skeptical. Soon after, Mary appeared before one of these people and, after commanding him to believe what the woman had told him, she relieved his distress.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at her church built in her name in the country of sǝmrata Ab: There was a chosen woman there who loved Our Lady Mary and her Son Jesus Christ. She never left the church either by day or by night before the priest blessed with the concluding words, [saying, “May] God [be with you all”]. They used to give her, where she stood, one support stick out of their support sticks which they use at their standing place. They designated that stick “the stick of the woman”. When the clergy would leave the church, she would give the stick back to them, and they would put it together with their sticks. Now, this was their usual custom. On one of the days, the woman thought to go to the place of the saints to pay homage to the place of the saints and to receive their blessing. She thought of this and prayed to Our Lady Mary, saying to her, “Give me a sign, if it is your will that I go. If it is not your will, give me a sign so I may remain”. She said this and went home. As she entered the church (precinct) the next day, she found the stick outside the wall. She picked it up, wondering, saying, “Who brought it out?” She said this and brought it in with her. That day, too, she left it with their support sticks. And the next day, she found it outside and brought it in, wondering as before, and left it with their support sticks. The next day she found it (outside) as before. When this thing happened three days, she asked the clergy, saying, “Do you take the stick out?” They said to her, “No”. After this, she took a spiritual priest aside from people, and told him how she prayed to Our Lady Mary to allow her to go to another country. The priest heard and said to her, “This matter (shows that) it is the good will of Our Lady Mary. Go where you intended to. And take the stick with you. Verily, she has given you the stick”. The woman left. When she arrived where she intended to, (Our Lady) appeared to her that same night and said to her, “There are two distressed people in this country. Tell them, (saying,) ‘Our Lady Mary says to you do not feel distressed. Regarding your distress, I know about it. I will mitigate it for you, because you are my servants. I do not forget what one asks me earlier.’” After she told them this message – that she had sent her for – she proceeded to where she intended to. And they heard the word that Our Lady Mary had sent (to them) through the woman. They heard and said (with some doubt), “We will see it, if it is true!” In those days, Our Lady Mary appeared to one of the two distressed people. At noon, as he was standing in church, she arrived openly with Abuna Gabra Manfas Qǝddus, and said to him, “Believe what the woman has told you. It is true. Truly, it is my word that I sent to tell you. Today, too, I shall defend you. I shall not leave you to remain distressed”. She said this and disappeared from his eyes. See the miracles of Our Lady! She does not abandon those who love her nor ignore them. She brought the woman where she wanted (to go). And she calmed those distressed people from the disturbance of the enemy. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen. Greetings to you, you deserve praise, With the people of your household of the Monastery of Dabra Zamaddo. You, who are in body and who are in the soul. Pray for us to Jesus Christ, That he may gather us at his hall for the New Wedding feast. Greetings to you, flowers of Bartalomewos; And sticks of candles and oil of Abuna Yohannǝs, And Sinodos’s, perfume of Dabra Zamaddo. Pray for us, our fathers, to Mary the garden, Whose womb fruited food for the soul against death. “Greetings to his home country, greetings to his monastery and greetings to his tomb”, Say to you, (Sinodos), members of my body which are bound (to you) with the rope of love. O Sinodos, who is like your teacher Takla Amin, If you are searching for my love, let it be known by your feet.</ab>
