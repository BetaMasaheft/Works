            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>A monk named Habta Sellase was searching for the icon of Mary from Dabra Zamaddo. This monk had traveled far, and when he arrived at Dabra Lalibala, Mary came to him and told him that her icon had been hidden there ever since its removal from Dabra Zamaddo. Mary directed him to a nearby church. There Habta Sellase inquired about the icon, but nobody knew anything about it. He fell asleep in despair, but Mary came to him in a dream and showed him the exact place where her icon lay hidden. When he woke up, he went to the location Mary had shown him and found the icon. On the journey to return the icon to Dabra Zamaddo, Habta Sellase came upon a fork in the road. Mary instructed him to take the path on the right. She also urged him to hurry, since a black dog was coming along the other road. Habta Sellase and his retinue had walked for three miles when one of his servants said he needed to return to the fork to retrieve a forgotten item. Habta Sellase begged the servant to heed Mary’s warning, but he did not. When the servant arrived at the fork, he discovered not a black dog but Arami soldiers, who promptly killed him.</p>

                <ab>Listen! Let us tell you a miracle which Our Lady Mary worked when she willed the return of her icon to Dabra Zamaddo, for they had left it in the city of Ruha: She talked to a certain monk, who was a God-lover and her lover. He was living in Dabra Azazo, coming from Dabra Libanos. The name of the monk was Habta sǝllase. She said to him, “Take me home. For I have been in Dabra Lalibala since I left my country”. When the monk heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he rose up quickly and went in haste to where she directed him. He arrived at the church of Mary, called ʿAmda Bǝrhan, and inquired about and searched for the news of the icon, of its coming formerly and its presence there. He inquired with the noblemen who had survived there. They replied to him, saying, “We were not here before because we are strangers. We have not heard any news that it came from elsewhere, nor do we know of its presence here”. (The monk) was shocked and was saddened very much. He was depressed for his coming from far. He said, “My toil was in vain. This must be the work of my enemy. No one else would do this”. He said this and cried bitterly. He fell on the ground and rolled himself, saying, “How would the enemy appear in the likeness of My Lady?” Saying so, he cried and lamented. Because of his excessive sorrow and his crying, he was exhausted. He leaned against a wall and had a short sleep. At that moment, Our Lady Mary came to him and said to him, “Do not be sad. For your coming was not of Satan, but of the good will of God (which) brought you and made you reach here. I am, indeed, here”. She said this and directed him to the place where she was. She said to him, “Open that window, because I am in it”. When he heard the words of Our Lady Mary, he rose up from his sleep and went to the window and opened it quickly. He found (the icon) sǝʿǝla Adhǝno in it. He rejoiced very much when he found it, because what Our Lady told him was the truth, not a lie (from Satan). He took it out of the window, carried it and took it to its country. As he traveled, he came to the top of Ǝngafat at the juncture of two roads, one that went toward Ǝngafat and the other that went toward Yagar Laʾlay. When he came to the juncture of the two roads, he rested a while. At that moment, Our Lady Mary said to him, “Rise up quickly and take the road on the right that goes toward the monastery. Do not tarry here because a black dog is coming by the road on the left. Pick me up quickly lest it pollute me by touching (me)”. He heard and took the road she directed him to take. After he walked (a distance of) three miles, one of his servants said to him, “Let me go back to where we had rested, because I forgot something (there). I will go and bring it”. (His master) said to him, “Behold, do not go (back); let it be left. Behold, (Our Lady) had told me, saying, ‘Rise up quickly. A dog is coming; let it not pollute me by touching (me).’” Although his master told him this, he refused (to listen) and went back to where he had left his thing because the man was originally a violator of orders. He did not listen to the words of others. He did not do but what his mind thought, because his look was black. The house of his origin was from the race of Ham. When he came to where he had left his thing, as he picked it up, the Arami, which Our Lady Mary called a dog, and (because of which) told (the monk), “Pick me up quickly lest it pollute me by touching (me)”, found him. The Arami killed the servant on the spot. Listen, our brothers! If a habit – however it happened – is established, and people say, “The behavior of so and so is such”, it never separates from him even for a day, but brings him to such a destiny. And his end is the Hell of fire. Let us go back to the story of the icon: (The monk) brought her to her home with much search, herself guiding him and keeping herself. May her prayer and petition and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
