             <ab>A miracle performed by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, may her prayer and her blessing be with our King Yohannes1 and with his servant Gabra Kidan forever and ever, amen.
A servant was entrusted to a certain man [by his master], but he hated that man inwardly.2
The servant plotted, saying, “If I kill myself, then they will arrest and kill the one who beat me. [They will think my trustee killed me].”
Following this logic, he took out his knife, cut his own throat, and died.
Then that trustee3 came and found the servant dead.
The trustee went to the Church of Our Lady Mary, weeping bitterly.
He cried out [to the Lord], “Resuscitate this man for me! [Otherwise,] that man who put me in charge of this stranger4 will be upset with me!”
Instantly, Our Lady Mary appeared to him. She said, “Reunite his head with his corpse and sew it on with thread.”
When the trustee did just as Mary had commanded him, the dead man [suddenly] came back to life.5 The dead man then testified about how he had killed himself.
This miracle and many others of that church became known throughout the land. Indeed, if each of them was written down, it would not be possible for them all to fit in one book.
May her prayer and her blessing be with us, forever and ever, amen.</ab>
