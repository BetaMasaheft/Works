                <p>A posthumous Miracle of Mary. In the land of Malko Amba there lived a married man who took a concubine into his house. After quarreling with him, this man’s wife sent a letter to Abbuna Yohannes at Dabra Zamaddo and asked for his help. The abbot went to the married couple and offered them spiritual counsel. The husband cast the concubine out of his house, and peace was restored. Five months later, the husband brought the concubine back. This occurred during the rainy season, when the river Sellare was impassable. The husband taunted his wife, knowing that Abbuna Yohannes would not be able to come again. But God revealed this woman’s tribulations to Abbuna Yohannes, and he prayed that Mary might help. Upon hearing the abbot’s plea, Mary told him to go to the river and divide the water with his cross. He followed her instructions, and after passing through the divided waters, Abbuna Yohannes went to the man and arrested him. Neighbors came out to intercede, begging the abbot to let the man go. Out of his love for Mary, Abbuna Yohannes eventually decided to release his prisoner.

                <ab>Listen, our brothers! Let us tell you a miracle which Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, worked for Abuna Yohannǝs:
                    
                    There was, during the time of Abuna [that is, "Our Father,"] Yohannǝs, a certain man in the land of Malko Amba. 
                    
                    When that man quarreled with his wife, his wife sent a message to Abuna Yohannǝs, the abbot of Dabra Zamaddo. 
                    
                    She sent [a message], saying, “What shall I do with this husband of mine? He saddens me terribly and depresses me so much? Should I come to you, and leave him behind? For he married [an additional] woman besides me.”
                    
                    When Abuna Yohannǝs heard, he went to [see] them.
                    
                    He arrived and preached to them, enabling them to understand many spiritual matters. He reminded them of the body's death, the soul's death, and going down into the grave and standing before the Creator.
                    
                    Then he made peace between them.
                    
                    The husband expelled his concubine from his house and sent her away.
                    
                    The Abuna accomplished this and left for his country.
                    
                    Five months later, when it was the season of Keramt, and the [river] water of Tsǝllare rose high, knowing that people cannot cross and pass over [the river) during the season of Keramt, that man brought back his concubine and settled her in his house.
                    
                    He rebuked his wife, saying to her, “Now, let this Abuna of yours, about whom you always boast, help you.”
                    
                    His wife was silent, knowing that the water would not let people pass.
                    
                    Her husband addressed her with many abusive words, saying, “Why doesn't this Abuna and teacher of yours, about whom you always boast, help you today?” Saying things like this, he addressed her with many abusive words.
                    
                    But she did not reply with a single word, but only poured her tears like a spring of water. Yes, her eyes poured [tears] like the rain of Kramt.
                    
                    Abuna Yohannǝs knew about her suffering because God had revealed it to him. So, “Her father” [that is, the Abuna,] rose up immediately and entered the shrine.
                    
                    He prayed to, and begged, Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, saying to her, “What should I do? This case is anguishing me. I cannot go because the season is Keramt, and the water is dreadful; it is impossible to cross [the river. Nor can I remain [doing nothing] because the oppression of the woman saddens me. And the abuse of that man burns my heart. Doesn't the Scripture say, ‘The word of mockery destroys the soul like wax in the presence of the face of fire.’”
                    
                    When he told the case to Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, then, Our Lady Mary, having heard this, allowed him to go and divide the water with his cross, and put the arrogant man to shame by his going, because he would be so shocked when the Abuna came to him, [and] when he saw the Abuna's face.
                    
                    When Abuna Yohannǝs heard the words of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, he left immediately.
                    
                    When he came to [the River] Tsǝllare, he blessed the water with his cross, as she had instructed him. The water divided, standing up on the right and on the left. The middle became dry land.
                    
                    Abuna Yohannǝs passed across the dry land, like Joshua, the prince of Israel. Abuna Yohannǝs crossed [the river] and came to that violator of the law.
                    
                    When that man saw the face of Abuna Yohannǝs, he became like a dead man due to being startled.
                    
                    The Abuna arrested that man, binding his hands and legs. The man wailed and brought some to intercede on his behalf. The whole area begged the Abuna to release him, to forgive him totally. They adjured him in [the name of] Our Lady Mary and in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ to release him.
                    
                    That was difficult for our father. 
                    
                    They adjured him in the name of his Creator and in the name of Our Lady Mary, lest he refuse them, because Our Lady Mary’s habit is generosity and Our Lord Jesus’ habit is forgiveness.
                    
                    After all, Our Lady Mary had [already] shown her power to the violator of the law by the Abuna coming to him in the season of Kramt.
                    
                    [Therefore,] the Abuna accepted their petition and forgave the oppressor for the sake of all things that Our Lady Mary had done for him, and having noticed (it).
                    
                    The Abuna released that man from his bonds when they adjured him in the name of Our Lady Mary because our father was reasonable. Because she had first received his prayer and brought him to the violator of the law in the season of Keramt, the Abuna, too, forgave that man for the sake of the name of Our Lady Mary.
                    
                    Then, he reconciled him with his wife.
                    
                    See, my brothers, the generosity of Our Lady Mary! When Abuna Yohannǝs prayed to her, although the water of [the River] tsǝllare was full, she made dry land in its middle, specifically for him, and he passed over on dry land. He came to where he intended to and fulfilled his desire. And the violator of the law was released from the iron bonds on his body and soul, when people adjured in her name.
                    
                    May the prayer of Our Lady be a buffer and shield forever and ever. Amen.
