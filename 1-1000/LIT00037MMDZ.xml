            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>One day, a thief stole a lectern from Dabra Zamaddo and brought it to Mahdara Krestos, the ruler of Tatara. Mahdara Krestos thought the lectern was beautiful, and he paid the thief a large sum for it. In his happiness, the ruler summoned the people of his household to view his purchase. But when a young man named Takla Haymanot saw the lectern, he knew it rightfully belonged to Mary of Dabra Zamaddo. Hearing this, Mahdara Krestos confronted the thief, who in turn admitted his crime. The ruler then commanded the thief to return the stolen lectern to Dabra Zamaddo, accompanied by Takla Haymanot as an escort. When the two came to the land of Wasan, the thief attempted to flee. But Takla Haymanot threw his spear at the thief’s legs, and the man fell down. Takla Haymanot then brought the thief before Abbuna Sama Iyyasus. The people wanted to execute or maim the thief, but the abbot decided to let him go so that Mary could do with him as she wished.</p>

                <ab>A miracle of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, which she worked and showed her power on a thief: He stole her lectern and brought it to Mahdara Krǝstos, the ruler of tatara. When the ruler saw it, he was exceedingly happy, because it was beautiful, one soaked and dyed in paint. (The ruler) gave the thief a lot of money for its price. Because of his great happiness, the ruler summoned the people of his household, men as well as women, and assembled them and said to them, “See, I have acquired what would not be found even in palaces”. One young man, whose name was Takla Haymanot, replied to his master, saying to him, “Does not this property belong to Our Lady of Dabra Zamaddo, which is exhibited with her icon at the honoring of her holy day, and the whole world sees it?” The ruler heard and called the thief and asked him, “Where did you bring it from?” The thief said, “I brought it from Dabra Zamaddo”. The ruler heard and admired the power of Our Holy Lady. He said, “If I had not summoned the people of my household, and if I had not shown this property to them, who would have told me that it was the property of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God?” All the people said, “But this wisdom is not others’ but Our Lady’s”. The ruler said to the young man, “Take this thief (to Dabra Zamaddo), making him carry back what he had brought”. He took him, making him carry (it). When the thief came to the land of Wasan, he bolted to flee. The young man threw his spear and hit (the thief’s) two legs with the spear. (The thief) fell down by the power of God. The young man raised him up and took him to Dabra Zamaddo and presented him to the abbot. The abbot assembled the people of the monastery and asked them what they should do with the thief. Some said, “Let us execute him”. And some said, “Let us amputate his hands and feet”. But Abuna tsama Iyyasus said, “Let us let him go. Let Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God do with him whatever she wants, as she has brought him there”. They released the thief from his binding, and let him go wherever he wanted because she has brought us her property, what else do we want? May her prayer and blessing save us from sudden death, and keep us from thieves, forever and ever. Amen. </ab>
