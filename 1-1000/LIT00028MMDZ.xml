            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>In the country of Samro, there was a priest who served in Mary’s church. This priest was also a skilled carpenter, and for his carpentry he cut down many trees. Mary, who did not approve of the priest cutting down her trees, asked him to stop. But the priest refused. Next, Mary asked the people of Samro to stop the priest, but he refused to listen to them as well. To admonish the priest, Mary started to make his tools disappear. Nevertheless, the priest persisted in his work, encouraging others to cut down trees for him. Seeing this, Mary began to burn down any house constructed with trees from her precinct. But this action had the effect of hardening not just the priest’s heart, but also the hearts of people in the community. Mary responded to their stubbornness by declaring that the priest must not live in her country, nor would he be buried there. The priest left, and when he died he was buried outside the fence of the church.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at a church built in her name in the area of Samro[, Ethiopia].
                    There was a certain priest who served in her church. The man was knowledgeable and well-versed in the Scriptures.
                    This priest did all sorts of manual work [but his specialty was that] he cut her trees.
                    So, Our Lady told him, “Stop! My heart does not love people who cut my trees.”
                    But, he refused to obey and did not stop cutting her trees.
                    Indeed, he told everybody the words she had said to him.
                    After he refused to obey her, Mary went to the faithful and said, “Please, deliver me from this man.”
                    But they, too, refused [to obey].
                    After that, she brought on him a mild punishment. She began to make his iron tools disappear. They never remained overnight, whether he had them made [for him], bought [them], or borrowed [them] from people.
                    Now, the work the man did was not only for himself, but also for others. When he built their houses, he would suggest to them to cut [the trees down], whether it be for a beam or a shutter. Whatever it was, he would not give her respite. The loss of his axe did not warn him off either.
                    Having seen this, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, changed her punishment to burning houses down with fire. The fire - whether it was arson or one that started [naturally] in their house, however it happened - would burn [the house] down. She did not let anyone's [house built with wood] cut from her precinct to stand a single year.
                    But, the man and the area's people were not warned by this either, because the enemy had thickened their hearts. 
                    When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw the stubbornness of their hearts, she said to the man, and informed the area's people that, “This man shall not live in my district and he shall not be buried inside the fence of the church.”
                    So, the man went to another country.
                    When the time for his death came, he said, “Do not bury me inside the fence.” Indeed, he put the people there under an anathema should they bury him inside the fence.
                    So, he was buried outside the fence and in the path that the cows walked [and defecated on].
                    This happened in order that the words she had told him might be fulfilled. [Look,] although he was a priest and bishop, he was buried outside the fence for Our Lady had said to him, “You shall not be buried inside the fence of the church” and her words were fulfilled.
                    May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
