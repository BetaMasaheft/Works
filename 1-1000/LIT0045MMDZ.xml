                <p>Two pagan youths who hated Mary and insulted her constantly lost everything they owned. So, on the twenty-first day of Tarr (around January 15), they brought an offering to the church and confessed their sins against Mary. Mary forgave them, and they rejoiced to find their old lives restored.</p>

             <ab>Two pagan youths hated the name of Mary. They spoke insultingly about her and despised her virginity with all their heart. They lived like this for a long time.
Then, all their possessions, children, and savings came to an end.
So, they went to the church of Our Lady Mary, the Virgin, the Mother of God, on the 21st of the month of Tir [January 7]. They took an offering and gave it to the priest. They also confessed their sin, how they had spoken insultingly about Our Lady Mary.
[They came to confess because] they had come to understand that she was the one who had destroyed their livelihood.
[After they confessed], she clearly told them, “Go! Don’t sin again! Don’t insult me again!”
They rejoiced joyously [because their life] returned to the way it had been.
They [later] died, at peace because of the prayers of Our Lady Mary, the Mother of God.
May her prayers and blessings, and the mercy of her son, be with Kola Dǝngǝl forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
