            <abstract>
                <p>There was certain man who, though only a Christian in name, loved Mary and celebrated the feast of her Dormition. However, he was also an adulterer. He was brought to the seat of judgment in heaven, where his deeds were examined. He confessed to his sins, and the people condemned him. The Lord then sentenced him to the fate of adulterers, which involved being fed to an enormous serpent with gnashing teeth. This man cried out to Mary, who stood by the Lord’s side, and he asked for her help. Mary appealed to the Lord on the man’s behalf, and the Lord forgave his sins.</p>

             <ab>In one town, there was a nominal Christian who loved Our Lady Mary and wholeheartedly commemorated the feast of her Dormition. However, he was very adulterous!
One day, while he was sleeping, he was taken to the Throne of Judgment. They questioned him about his deeds. He confessed and did not deny it at all, for there is nothing hidden before the Lord. Then they called for the Judges to sentence him according to his deeds.
As they were condemning him, Lady Mary was standing at her son’s right hand, listening to [the confessions and condemnations] about the man.
Then the Lord commanded that the man be shown the judgment for adulterers: an immeasurably long and wide serpent whose mouth was open, swallowing and spitting out [adulterers]. Then the Lord commanded that the man be taken to the place of weeping and gnashing of teeth.
The man turned around and looked at Our Lady Mary, crying out, “My Lady, the hope of the desperate, bail me out of my due punishment!”
When Our Lady heard his voice, she went to where he was and covered him with her clothes so that the terrifying condemnation army might not hurry him [to his punishment]. Then she took him back to where she was and stood him [with her].
Bowing down to the Lord, she prayed, saying, “Have mercy on this sinner. Absolve him of his sin. I guarantee that he will not return to his former sin.”
When the Lord heard his mother’s prayer, his heart became compassionate. He commanded the sinner to be brought forward and stood before him. They brought the sinner before him.
Then the Lord rebuked the sinner, [saying,] “O sinful man! Beware and don’t sin [again]! Go! Your sin is forgiven! After this, be my mother’s minister until your death.”
The sinner received favor before the Lord and returned in joy, accompanied by angels who said to him, “Greetings, Mary’s servant, whom she bailed out from the terrifying judgment! Blessed are you, who are not rewarded according to your deeds! From now on, thank Our Lady Mary!”
May her prayer and blessings be with our king, Yohannnes, and his servant, Gabra Kidan, forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
