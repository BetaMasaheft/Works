                <p>In a town called Wandige, there was a church devoted to Mary, and this church had a millstone used to grind wheat for the Eucharist. One day, a dog licked the millstone. The people reported the incident to the mayor, and he had the old millstone replaced with a new one. The dog came again a few days later, and just before it could lick the new millstone, Mary killed it. She made it rigid like stone, and it remained standing upright in the place where it died. The people praised Mary.</p>

                <note>Translated by Mehari Worku with Wendy Laura Belcher. <ref type="mss" corresp="EMDA180">EMDA (HMML) 180</ref>, in 2022. </note>
                
                 
                
                <ab>Listen to what Our Lady Mary did, dear Fathers and brothers.
This is a miracle and wonder [that happened] in a town named Wandge. There was a church that had been built in the name of
Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary,
the Compassionate One, the Mother of Mercy,
the Mother of God, the Mother of the Creator, the Mother of the Maker,
the Mother of the Sun of Righteousness,
the Ark of Salvation, the Witness to Our Freedom.
By her, we are saved from sin.
By her, we arise from death.
By her, we the sick are healed from suffering.
By her, we the poor become rich from poverty.
By her, we the sad rejoice from sadness.
By her, we the laboring find rest from toil.
By her, we the hungry become satisfied with abundant life.
By her, we the thirsty quench our thirst with salvation’s cup.
By her, we the naked become clothed with the garments of joy and delight.
By her, we the lowly are lifted up to the heavens.
She is the angels’ glory.
She is the prophets’ prophecy.
She is the apostles’ news.
She is the martyrs’ crown.
She is the righteous’ splendor.
She is the jewel of the daughters of Eve.
She is the bride of the resurrection.
She is the mother of light.
Our Lady, the Pure Virgin Mary, the Mother of God.
We heard an astonishing story, told to us by those from among the faithful [who were there].
There was a stone for grinding wheat in that church [of Wandge, to prepare the bread] for the service of the Divine Mystery [the Eucharist].
[One day,] a dog came up and licked the millstone. When the people saw this they were scared and terrified. So, they reported to the town mayor that a dog had licked the millstone.
After hearing this, the mayor said, “Throw that millstone away. I will give you another one.”
So, the people threw the millstone away and installed a new one.
But, after a few days, that dog came again to lick the millstone, as it was accustomed to doing.
Before it could come close to the millstone, however, Our Lady Mary killed the dog. She made it rigid as a stone, but without falling to the ground. Rather, she made it stand still like a plant, without moving to the right or to the left.
When the people saw this, they were [again] scared and terrified, and praised Our Lady, the Praised one, the Glorified one, the Compassionate one, the Mother of Life, Mary.
Who can be compared to her?
Who is like her, whether human or angel?
With whom can we compare her?
With the heaven of Gelgela1?
With the entire earth?
With the sun, the stars, and the moon?
She is the one who bore the creator in her pure womb.
Her words are sweeter than honey and sugar.
May she ask mercy for us from her son,
Jesus Christ, the bequeather of joy.
May she protect us from the front and from the back,
So that Belhor the snatching wolf may not draw near.
[May her prayer be] with me, the steward of her church,
And with all of us men and women who bow down to the greatness of her power.
Those who say we do not bow down to Mary and her icon,
and do not believe in her miracles,
may they be thrown into the very depths of Gehanna!
Forever and ever, amen!
May her prayer be with her servant Welde Selassie, forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
