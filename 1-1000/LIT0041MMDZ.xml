            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript
                in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName

            <abstract>
                <p>King Zara Yaqob entered a church that was built for Mary. As he stood before her
                    tabot to pray, he leaned against a column. Upset with his disrespectful
                    behavior, Mary admonished the king with the words: “Do not press on me!” Mary,
                    who possesses the power to speak through objects, went on to explain why it was
                    disrespectful to lean against walls or columns in church. This story of Mary
                    rebuking Zara Yaqob clarifies why Lalibala avoided using columns in any of the
                    ten churches he constructed during his reign as king.</p>

                <ab>A miracle that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, the Bearer of God, [performed, in which she explained something] to the righteous and faithful King Zara Yaqob when he entered a church, and [in which she] revealed secrets of the church.
                    The church was built in the name of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God.
                    When the king stood before her tabot to pray and leaned against a column, she admonished him, saying, “Why do you push me? Don't press on me!” 
                    Listen, my brothers! Comprehend this matter. Was not this column, which spoke this to him, [merely] a stone? Do you think that stone really had a tongue? God forbid!
                    Rather, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, imitator of many objects, spoke to him not the column [of stone]. 
                    A stone talking has never been heard of since the beginning [of time]. Until today, no story has been found of saints who talked with a stone, not one [such story] has been found. Yes, [rocks] had sprung water for the saints, when they struck them.
                    But talking [out of a stone] belonged to Our Lady, to explain to the king that it was not right [to lean on her] in church. She explained to him that people should not lean against a wall, sitting or standing, [in a church,] so we may believe her words. 
                    Lalibela's construction of ten churches is [more] evidence for us that leaning in church is not right.
                    Look, check for yourself, see if you can find even one [church]  he built that had a column. He avoided building columns when he realized that leaning in church is not right. He would have built [columns], if it were right.
                    O brothers, what will she, who said to the righteous and meek Zara Yaqob, “Don't push me,” do to us, who spread ourselves [out flat] like a board [in church] and sleep like a dead person? And, when we wake up, we entertain ourselves with backbiting and useless joking around. 
                    O my brothers, comprehend the lesson of the Lady of all!
                    May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Walatta Sara [forever and ever. Amen.]</ab>
