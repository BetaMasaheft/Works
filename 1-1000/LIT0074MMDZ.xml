             <ab>This is a miracle [performed] by Our Holy Lady Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer be with us forever and ever, amen.
A [noble] woman with a husband loved Our Holy Lady Mary, the Two-fold Virgin, the Mother of God, and that woman trusted in Our Lady’s prayers.
When a time of trouble descended upon the whole country, she left with the king [to his roving tent court].
But in the place where she was staying for the night, young people holding spears began fighting among themselves.
Afraid and terrified, the woman stood [frozen, watching the fight.] Right then, [behind her back,] some thieves stole all her possessions, bracelets and rings made from gold and silver, along with a lot of other golden jewelry.
When she turned back, she couldn’t find her possessions and she wept and screamed.
After taking her possessions, the thieves brought them to one of the local rulers. They [the servants of the ruler] took the possessions and held onto them. But, the woman did not know this.
 So, she went to the tent chapel of Our Holy  Lady Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, and stood before Our Lady and prayed passionately.
With bitter tears flowing from her eyes, she prayed, “My dear Lady, you know that I don’t have any help except from you. Help me and show me your miracle today!”
Instantly, one of the rulers saw her and asked, “Why are you crying so bitterly, madam?”
She replied, “I am seeking help from Our Holy  Lady Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, because somebody has taken away my possessions.”
That ruler brought her to another local ruler and told him [about what had happened to her].
Then, the two rulers checked everything that was captured from the thief.
She saw it and exclaimed, “It's mine! It doesn’t belong to anyone else.”
They questioned her further [to ensure that the jewelry truly belonged to her] and she told them everything that had happened.
The rulers [marveled and] said, “What are the good deeds that you do for God, for you to receive this splendid miracle today?”
She replied, “I don't have any good works! Rather, it's because of the help of the Our Holy Lady Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, Holy Mary’s that this miracle was performed.”
The rulers gave back all her possessions and she accepted them, returning home to her husband happily and joyfully.
Our dear Holy Lady Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, may your prayer and supplication be with your servant … forever and ever. Amen. </ab>
