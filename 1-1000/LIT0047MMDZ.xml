            <creation>This story, with the short title "Icon Next to a Couple's Bed," is recent: the earliest PEMM manuscript* in which this story appears is from around <date>1850</date>.Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>A man named Walda Iyasus describes how a certain icon of Mary passed into the hands of a man named Aleqa Tessema, who was the head scribe for the king of Gojjam. Aleqa Tessema purchased the icon from some pilgrims and brought it to Jerusalem. Although he devoted himself to this icon, he installed it in an impure place—that is, on a pedestal near the bed where he slept with his wife. Walda Iyasus tells how this icon appeared to him in a dream. The icon called out to him and told him about how Aleqa Tessema had put her in an unseemly place. She then instructed him to go visit Aleqa Tessema and convince him to place her in the church of St. George in the town of Od Teklay. Walda Iyasus did as Mary instructed, and when he told Aleqa Tessema of his vision, the scribe acted immediately. He gave this icon, as well as a second icon he’d purchased in Hamasen, to his servant, who then delivered them to churches in the Gojjam region. The first icon went to the monastery of Martula Maryam, and the other went to Dabbo. Walda Iyasus concludes by describing how the icon appeared to him again, asking him to record this miracle story.</p>

                <note>Translated by Mehari Worku with Wendy Laura Belcher. <ref type="mss" corresp="EMDA10">EMDA (HMML) 10, s. 241b</ref>, in 2022. </note>
             <ab>An icon of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, is in the city of the Ruler of Rulers, [the monastery of] Martula Maryam, that glorious city that was built by the glorious Kings of Axum Abraha and Atsbaha.
This monastery was consecrated by Abba Salama the Illuminator.
When that icon of Our Lady Mary came from Jerusalem, the head scribe [for the king of Gojjam] Aleqa Tessema bought the icon from some pilgrim monks with his own gold.
After that man bought the icon, his heart was burning with love for Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, because of the icon’s beauty. [He also bought] a second icon in the region of Hamasen.
When the icon arrived from Jerusalem [and he bought it], he put her in a place in his house that was impure. [But,] he bought her because he was devoted to her. [Indeed, after] he bought the icon, he was devoted to it and adorned it with silk cloth. He also made an extraordinary, flawless, pedestal for the icon of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-Fold Virgin, the Mother of God, adorning [that] with cloth [too].
However, the pedestal he had made for this icon, as well as for the other icon of Our Lady Mary, was close to the head of his bed, where he slept with his wife. By the way, this man, [Tessema,] his baptismal name was Kidana Maryam.
Therefore, the icon did not want to be on this pedestal, which was [in an] impure [place]. Rather, she wanted to be on a pure pedestal.
As David says in the Psalms, “I do not want your sacrifices and offerings. Rather, clean your body for me! I do not want a sin offering.”
[Meanwhile,] while I, the sinner Walda Iyasus, who is a pauper in knowledge and an owner of many sins, was sleeping in a distant place, that very icon appeared to me [in a dream]. Her beauty was marvelous; she looked as if she was [alive,] in the flesh. Whoever saw that icon would have his heart consumed with love for her. For the Holy Spirit was dwelling in that icon just as the Holy Spirit dwelled in that [famous] icon of Our Lady Mary in the [Syrian] town of Sedeneya.
[But,] let’s return to the earlier story. That icon came [to me] in my dream, while I was sleeping in a distant place.
The icon called out to me three times saying, “Walda Iyasus! Walda Iyasus!”
[Then, the icon instructed me. She] said, “In the morning, rush to visit your brother. Before [you do that, though], let me tell you what your brother did to me! He brought me from the pilgrim monks, where I had been living in a pure place. But, today, he put me in an unseemly place, inside his house where he sleeps with his wife.”
I replied with fear and trembling in my dream, [because] I thought I was awake. [I said,] “What shall I do?”
The icon replied, “Tell him, ‘Why did you put me on an impure pedestal, where you lie down and sleep with your wife! This place where I am now is impure. Take me and put me inside the Church of St. George that is in the middle of the town of Od Teklay.”
That night, the icon told me this three times. [When] I woke up in the morning, I went to where that icon had sent me.
I asked my brother, “Is there an icon of Mary in your house?”
He replied, “Yes, there are two icons.”
When he showed [them to] me, one was that icon that had spoken to me in the dream! It was [placed] just like the icon had told me.
[When I told] my brother, he became terrified and acted immediately. He took the icon to a nearby church and placed her in the sanctuary in a place of honor.
Then, in a few days, he took the icon out, got the other icon, and sent them both with one of his servants. The servant brought the icons to the Gojjam region, taking the [first] icon to [the monastery of] Martula Maryam and the other icon to Dabbo. Both icons remain in those places in glory.
I wrote this [miracle story], not for the sake of vain glory, but rather because that icon kept appearing to me day and night [and demanding I do so]. My mind continued to be troubled because of this matter.
[After all this,] the icon [returned and] said to me, “Write the miracle story for my sake and send it to where I am now [in Martula Maryam].”
[Indeed,] after I wrote it, I found well-being and respite from my mind’s troubles. The icon never appeared to me again.
May her prayers and blessings be with us forever and ever. Amen.
