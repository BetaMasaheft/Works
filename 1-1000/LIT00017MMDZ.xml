            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>Abbuna Bartalomewos brought a tabot into the grotto at Dabra Zamaddo, and there he established a place to stand on top of a rock. The grotto was very dry, and one day, as the abbot was standing there, Mary caused milk to spring from under his feet. Abbuna Bartalomewos praised Mary for performing her miracle, then asked her to change the milk into water, as water was more appropriate for the monks. Mary heard the abbot’s request and changed the milk into water.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for Abuna Bartalomewos: After he brought the tabot inside the grotto, he made his standing place outside the grotto on the top of the rock which is very dry. One day, as he was standing, she caused white water to spring from under his feet. Its taste was like milk. Listen, my brothers! Everything Our Lady Mary does to her beloved ones is wonderful and amazing. This miracle deserves admiration and praise. When Abuna Bartalomewos saw this miracle – the water turning white – and drank from it, its taste was like milk. When Abuna Bartalomewos saw this, he said to his Lady, “If you have done for me what has not been done before for other saints, I beg you – say, yes to me – to change the appearance of this that you caused to spring from under my feet, into water, and its taste to be in accordance with its nature. This that happened today, if its appearance and taste become normal, will not benefit my children. Let (the water’s) taste be natural, so that the people of the country may not have it robbed from them and the rulers keep it for their own need. However, let not your help be ever removed, so that it may be a hope to my children”. And Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, accepter of the petition of all, did for him (what he asked): she made the milk water. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary, Bearer of God, and the power of the covenant (given) to Abuna Bartalomewos keep Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
