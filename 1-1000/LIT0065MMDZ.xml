                <p>In Cairo there lived a poor man named Bhor. Though he didn’t know the ways of the world, he loved Mary. A sinner named Demas decided to take advantage of this man naïveté and hatched a plot in which he stole the townspeople’s possessions and blamed the theft on Bhor. When the townspeople prayed for Mary to help them catch the thief, Demas spoke up and blamed the theft on Bhor. A message suddenly appeared on Demas’s forehead revealing him to be the true thief. Meanwhile, Bhor, along with his son Laeka Maryam, had messages on their foreheads identifying them to be servants of God and Mary.</p>

             <ab>The following is a rough draft as translation in English is not yet available: A miracle performed by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer and blessings be with her servant Gabra Kidan forever and ever. Amen.
In Cairo there was a rich man named Bhor. He was a good man. He didn’t have any possessions. He was feeble. He had a son named Laeke Maryam.1 He gave this name to his son due to his love for Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, the Ever Immaculate in body and mind, the True Virgin, Full of Grace, Whose Lock is Closed Forever.
Bhor was a godly man who did good deeds and had no violence and wickedness in him. He also didn’t know the doings of this world. Because of this, a man named Demas, who lived his entire life in theft and violence, plotted a scheme against Bhor.
The townspeople began complaining when their belongings were lost. They made a public prayer saying, “Dear Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, show [us] your miracle on the one who steals the belongings of your servants, who live in your courtyard relying on and trusting your miracle’s might and the might of your beloved son, Our Lord Jesus Christ, whom you bore in your womb, carried on your back, and cuddled on your lap.”
During their communal prayer, Demas the thief was with them. Pretending to be a good person, Demas, the vile hearted, vicious, perdition’s son, violence’s child, Satan’s begotten, was saying, “Who else could have taken your belongings except Bhor? He is the only one in this town who doesn’t have any possessions.”
The people listened to Demas and incarcerated Bhor, asking him, “Tell us! Did you take our belongings? You don’t have any possessions or property in this town. Who gives you clothes? Who provides you with food?”
The blessed Bhor said, “Aside from Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, there is no one [to judge] between me, you, and Demas, who accused me, saying, ‘Who else could have taken your belongings except Bhor? He is the only one in this town who doesn’t have any possessions or property.’”
As soon as Bhor said this, a message appeared on Demas’s face written with the color of leprosy. It read, “There is no thief in this town except Demas, perdition’s son, who accused Bhor, God’s servant!”
On Bhor’s and his son Laeke Maryam’s faces were also writings, which read, “A good man, God’s servant, the servant of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God!” It was written with golden ink, which shined like the sun.
This miracle was performed in Cairo amid the congregation by the power of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. They caught Demas and incarcerated him. They toured him across Cairo to show the miracle the Queen of All had performed.
All the people of Cairo prostrated themselves at Bhor’s and his son Laeke Maryam’s feet in great reverence and said, “You two truly are the servants of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God!”
When they [Bhor and his son] died, they entered the heavenly kingdom.
May her prayer and blessings be with her servant Gabra Kidan forever and ever. Amen. </ab>
