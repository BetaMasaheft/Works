                <p>The angel Gabriel went to Mary at night, warning her that King Herod’s soldiers would soon attack her and Joseph. Mary woke Joseph, and they fled from Bethlehem to Biegor. In the wilderness near Biegor there was a shrine to the Egyptian gods in the shape of baboons and rhinoceroses. From a distance, Mary cursed the Egyptian shrine and banished the demons from the statues. The local Egyptians lamented the departure of their gods from the shrine. When the gods attempted to return to the statues, the power of Mary’s prayer sent them away. The nearby Egyptians captured Joseph and began whipping him with a lash made from a palm tree. Mary prayed for God to save Joseph, thinking he was being tortured by Herod’s soldiers. Gabriel arrived with a flaming spear and chased the Egyptians away from Joseph. Gabriel then healed Joseph’s wounds before Joseph destroyed the Egyptian shrine by flipping the altar upside down. Upon seeing this, Mary instructed the family return to Bethlehem. Joseph wept for joy and sang a song about the land of Judah.</p>

             <ab>After two months, the angel Gabriel came to Our Lady Mary at midnight.
He said, “Peace to you, O blessed among women! You have stayed in this town for too long. You have been entertained and happy here, but Herod is looking for you, so you need to leave here. Herod’s servants will arrive in this town [soon].”
When Our Lady Mary heard this, she was afraid. In the morning, she said to Joseph, “Get up! Let’s get out of here.”
Joseph replied, “Yes, ma’am.”
They got up and left the town immediately, but all the townspeople followed her, begging her tearfully and sorrowfully to stay with them.
Our Lady Mary replied, “Why do you break my heart? Please go back home. If my son wills it, I will return to you again.”
The people returned to their homes, feeling forlorn and grieving because of their love for Our Lady Mary.
Our Lady Mary went on her way and reached the hot lowlands of Biegor. She stayed there for three days. In that wilderness was a shrine to the Egyptian gods. As sacrifices to these gods, the people brought numerous cattle and sheep. [Each of the statues of the] gods had the shape of a rhinoceros or a baboon.
Our Lady Mary saw them from afar and prayed, “Tbyatotolan, Tt’byaqopperan, Pp’awyas, Ppieagawyans, Awsabieq, Grmasea, Awawaw, Awaayas, Adonay! May the demons be ashamed because of your Holy Name!”
Immediately, the demons [in the god statues] fled.
The Egyptians cried out, “Why are you abandoning us? From now on, our country is doomed! Our enemies will come and besiege us! There will be no one to help us!”
They put ashes on their heads, tore their clothes, and groaned as if they were dying.
[When the demons heard this pleading], they tried to return to the Egyptians. But, when they approached [the shrine from above, which had] a wine pressing [rock], and tried to enter [their former home], they plummeted to the ground. For the Lord’s power was planted there [because Our Lady Mary had prayed] and the demons had no idea who was chasing them away.
The people said to each other, “What’s been happening to us!?” [Bewildered,] they looked to the right and to the left, [here and there]. And when they saw Joseph, they chased him down.
They demanded, “Where are you from, man?”
He replied, “From the Bethlehem of Judah.”
They said, “Are you truly from Bethlehem? We have heard that you people are sorcerers. It must be because of your sorcery that our gods have fled!”
So, they bound his hands behind his back, tied his feet, and laid him on the ground on his stomach. Then, they whipped him 40 times with [a lash made from] a palm tree.
Joseph screamed out, “My dear Lady, because of you and your son, I’m about to die!”
Our Lady Mary heard Joseph’s voice and thought that Herod’s soldiers were chasing after her. Terrified, she fled while praying in Hebrew, “Rokbadise, Amdariel, Amanuiel, Iyaiel, Berbadis!”
Immediately, the angel Gabriel came down holding a burning spear.
Gabriel said, “My dear Lady Mary, don’t be scared! For I am with you, day and night. I’m never going to leave your side.”
Our Lady Mary replied, “Dear angel of the Lord, save me from Herod’s soldiers.”
Gabriel replied, “Don’t think that [what you’re hearing] is Herod’s soldiers. Rather, these are the idolater Egyptians. Even if all of the gentiles in the world gathered together and stood against you, I would have mowed them down like grain. They wouldn’t have been able to cut a single hair from your head.”
She replied, “[Please], help me in any way you can! For they are killing Joseph!”
Gabriel replied, “Don’t be afraid, my dear Lady Mary. Even if he dies, he will rise [again]. Even if he becomes sad, he will rejoice. Stay here to see a miracle!”
Then, Gabriel went to where they were beating Joseph. He unsheathed his burning sword and beat the ground with his wings [so that] a 39-cubit [tall pillar of] fire shot up from the earth into the air. He chased those Egyptians and that fire, which sprang from of his wings, incinerated them, every one of them, none of them was left. There were 99 [who died].
Gabriel then turned to Joseph, a Son of David, [and said,] “The Lord is your help.”
Immediately, Gabriel touched Joseph and healed him [from the abuse of the Egyptians]. He returned to health, as if nothing had happened to him. Joseph, then, went to that [shrine’s] wine-pressing rock.
The angel said to Joseph, “Measure this wine-pressing rock so that it might be recorded for later generations!”
Joseph measured the length of that rock. Its width was 190 [cubits] and its height was 49 [cubits]. Gabriel then picked up that [huge] rock and flipped it upside down so that the bowl side [where they pressed the grapes] faced down and its underside faced up.
Then, Joseph and Gabriel left that place[, the Egyptian shrine,] and went to Our Lady Mary, where the angel bowed down to her.
When Our Lady Mary saw Joseph, she hugged him, and said [with deep emotion,] “All this happened to you because of me and my son! Dear Joseph, my Father, let’s go [home,] to the Land of Judah. If we die there in Herod’s hand[, so be it.] Let our relatives bury us in the graveyard of our fathers.”
Joseph wept, remembering the country of his fathers. [He then sang:]
“Greetings to you, dear Bethlehem,
the land of the prophets of God,
Who is better than all wine!
Peace to you, dear Jerusalem,
the city of the Great King!
All you youth in the Land of Judah,
in Bethlehem and Jerusalem,
come and lament over my old age,
[come and lament] over that cursed hour
When the lot to be Our Lady Mary’s guardian befell me!”
They both cried so much that Gabriel himself cried with them.
But the angel told them, “This sadness will be forgotten. It won’t measure up to even a single day of your later joy. For the reward of sorrow is joy and the reward of joy is sorrow.”
May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved son be with her servant Gabra Maryam, forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
