            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>The church at Dabra Zamaddo was difficult to access, as it stood by a precipitous cliff, and people had injured themselves and even died while entering or exiting it. Abbuna Sama Iyyasus wondered how to make church access safer. One day a big tree near the church fell down. The abbot gave the order to cut the tree into logs and use them, along with some stones, to construct a path to the church. But the new path, which was intended to improve access, made matters worse, since it was not level and hence further obstructed the entrance. Dismayed, Abbuna Sama Iyyasus asked Mary to help level the crooked path. Mary heard his prayer. Despite the fact that it was the dry season, she caused a great rain to fall. The water poured down the cliff and on to the path, packing its crevasses with sand. In the morning the people of Dabra Zamaddo saw that the path had miraculously been leveled.</p>

                <ab>A miracle performed by Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-fold Virgin, the Mother of God, may her prayer and her blessings be with her servant Gabra Maryam, forever and ever amen.Listen, our brothers! Let us tell you about the miracle that Our Lady Mary performed for Abuna tsama Iyyasus, the abbot of Dabra Zamaddo. [She did so] because of his holiness, his love for her, and his service to God in fasting, prayer, prostration, and toil. He was a lover of people due to his humility. Therefore, she performed a miracle for him.
                    The main entrance [of the Church of Dabra Zamaddo] was on a [steep] slope with a pit and so people could only enter the church with much difficulty and struggle. Many fell while trying to enter or exit.
                    [To avoid the problem,] some entered through the Chapel of Takla Haymanot. Others tried to enter by [climbing from] the bottom of the slope, where water dripped down [making it slippery]. But the [main] entrance in the middle—[outside of] which is [now] level ground and a place where [even] the lame and the blind can run—where they entered and exited the church, was a huge slope with a pit. If someone fell down it, they could not stand up again in good health, but would be bruised and crushed. Some died.
                    Whenever Abuna tsama Iyyasus saw this [problem], he was saddened.
                    [One day, while] he was thinking about what he should do, a huge tree inside the church fence gate, on the right side of the Water of Life, fell.
                    Immediately, a thought came to him. He gave an order that people should cut the tree into pieces, which they did. Then, they placed the pieces of wood into the pit, adding stones and [more] logs, [until they reached the level] of the big rock foundation [of the church].
                    To his dismay, however, although he had intended to improve [the entrance,] the wood and stone that he had piled up made it worse. What he thought would improve it, [instead] prevented entry because the pile was not level.
                    The region’s people kept saying to him, “You thought you would improve it, but you made it worse for us!”
                    When he heard the people’s complaints, he prayed to Our Lady Mary, saying, “Many righteous people have taken refuge with you. [Some of them even] made a foundation on top of the water and built a church on it. [This happened] after you and your Son remembered the toil of their petition and accepted it. So, now, please do what I ask as well, and make level this crooked [place of logs and stones].”
                    When he asked her to fulfill his prayer, she heard his words. She brought down a torrent of rain, even though it was the dry season when the heat was like it was in Elijah’s time. She poured [so much] rain on the mountain that it created a landslide. She caused the soil to flow down in a single path, like a stream of water does, but not down the slope, but directly onto the [pile of] logs and stones. Sand filled it up! After that, the crooked place was no longer crooked. What people had left behind crooked [the previous] evening, they found level in the morning. It became a place so level that the blind and the lame could run there.
                    May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary,
                    which filled the crooked place with sand and made it accessible enough for anyone to cross,
                    also save us from the blaspheming Satan, forever and ever, amen.</ab>
