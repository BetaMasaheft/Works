            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>There was a monk named Walda Hawaryat, who came from Dabra Libanos but now lived in Dabra Zamaddo. He was a good Christian, and he understood the scriptures well. One day, he went to the chapel of the icon of Mary to grieve the crucifixion of her son. Whenever Walda Hawaryat thought of the crucifixion he would grow weak, and tears would stream from his eyes. One day Mary visited Walda Hawaryat while he was in such a state, and she asked him why he shed so many tears. He told her it happened whenever he thought about the Son of God’s suffering. Mary responded: “Was my son crucified for you only? Was he not crucified for the whole world?” Then she left.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Lady revealed and spoke to a certain monk called Walda hawaryat: He came from Dabra Libanos and lived in Dabra Zamaddo in seclusion. He was versed in the Scriptures and was practicing them. He was truly Walda hawaryat. One day, he entered the chapel of the icon of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, to mourn, remembering the crucifixion of her Son, because this was his habit. Whenever he remembered the sufferings of the Son of God, his energy would be weakened and his bones would be crushed. His tears, too, would come down like water from a fountain; and they would flow from his eyes like the rain of the time of Kramt and run down to his waist and reach his feet. The ground on which he stood would be wet with his tears. One day, as he was crying, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, said to him, “Walda hawaryat, why do you shed so many tears so that the ground is wetted?” He said to her, “O My Lady, I remember the sufferings of your Son”. And she said to him, “Was my Son crucified for you only? Was he not crucified for the whole world?” She said this and disappeared from him. Saintly people, whom Our Lady loved, heard her and wrote down this miracle. They also explained the matter to us: They said, “The reason she said, ‘Why do you shed so many tears’ was not for trivializing (the importance of) tears, but to strengthen (Walda hawaryat) from exhaustion and to show the strength of her love to all people who put their trust in her”. May her prayer and petition keep Walda Iyyasus forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
