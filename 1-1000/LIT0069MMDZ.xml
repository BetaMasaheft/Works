            <abstract>
                <p>A man named Wafelqalonie had been blind and paralyzed since birth. When he prayed for Mary to heal him, the Holy Virgin appeared, blessed him, and directed his prayer to God. Wafelqalonie then responded with a prayer for Christ to spare him on the day of Judgment. Elsewhere, a judge called to Mary to save him when his boat was about to sink in the sea. Mary prayed to Christ, and the judge was saved, along with all his servants and possessions.</p>

             <ab>Mary’s Miracle. She found a man named Wafelqalonie, who was born blind. He was sick from his birth. His head was never shaved.
(It is impossible for me to speak of Christ's greatness!)
Wafelqalonie stood and begged Mary, saying, “My dear Lady, the mother of my Lord, let me see your power and your miracle. For I have been paralyzed since my childhood. My entire body is withered. My relatives hate me in [their] frivolity. Listen to my supplication. Dear Full of Grace, dear Stream of Joy, accept my prayer! You are Adam’s hope when he was exiled from Paradise. You are the meekness of Abel, who was killed in violence. You are Seth’s and Enoch’s generosity. You are Noah’s Ark, in whom [Noah, his family, and all the animals] were saved.1 Our dear Lady, [heal me], who has been sick from my childhood!”
She raised her hand and blessed him. She looked to heaven and said, “My dear Lord and God, I beseech you. Show your face to me and [to this] sick man. Those who are far away, you bring them closer. Those who are fallen, you lift them up. Those who are stumbling, you secure them in your might.”
Mary finished her prayer and laid her hand on the paralytic, saying, “Stand up! Carry your bed!”
The paralytic stood up and went. He ran as someone who had a quick message to deliver.
He begged and implored Mary saying, “My dear Lady, from whom was born a bright star, the chief of all bright stars (that is, the souls of the righteous, all the conquering martyrs, ascetic monks, prophets speaking in the Holy Spirit, the blessed messenger Apostles, and all the Gathering of the First Born, the eternal, True Lord of All, who is eternal, to whom belongs existence, might and dominion, with his Father, who bore him as co-equal in person and dominion, with the Holy Spirit, who is never separated in existence and dominion) save me from lamentation and teeth gnashing on [that] unspeakable day, which is impossible to describe in human tongue—[the day] when your son sits on the throne of judgment.”
Let us also glorify and praise Mary for the miracle she performed on this blind.
When it becomes joy for the righteous and sadness for sinners, when the living and the dead are judged, when the good merry and rejoice, when a feast is prepared for the holy and pure children of baptism, may your savior son, in his mercy and compassion, join us with the blessed sheep, who were born of Holy Baptism and signed by the Tree of the Cross. And with all those with whom he was well pleased, may his mercy and compassion make me, your servant, join them and live.
I beg you my dear Lady, from whose womb flowed—without the seal of your virginity being opened—the stream that quenched [all thirst], make me from sinning cede, I beseech you, my dear Lady, who performed your miracle on me, and raised me, the paralytic, from [my] bed of [sickness], from you was born the living son who never dies.
When a boat was broken in the sea, a judge called out to Mary and said, “I beseech you, my Lady, the mother of my Lord, perform your miracles for me. Save me from the waves of the sea.”
The boat was broken in two.
Mary praised and prayed to her beloved son. And the Lord saved the judge through the prayer of Mary. None of his possessions or his servants were lost. The judge also was saved from the wave through the prayer of Mary.
May your prayer, [my Lady], also save your maidservant, Batra Aron.
I beseech you, my dear Lady, from whom was born the immortal living [Dues],
without opening the seal of your body’s gates,
make me walk on the right path, for desirable it is,
I beseech you, my Lady, who gave birth to the Image of the Father,2
without opening your virginity’s door,
my dear Lady, the mother of my Lord, as you saved the paralytic and the judge,
save me in your prayer, and the prayer of all the virgins who follow after you.
Glory to your son, glory to the one who made milk flow from your breasts. Remember me, your maidservant Batra Aron, forever and ever. Amen. Amen. Amen.</ab>
