            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>One night, an enemy pretended to be a boy who lived in Qwerbana’s household. The enemy was actually an Arami, and he convinced Qwerbana to go to the church for the New Year. The enemy led Qwerbana by torchlight. While they were walking, they came upon a fork in the path. Qwerbana suggested taking the path on the right, but the enemy did not want people to see them, so he insisted on going to the left and entering the shrine by the beta lehem ("house of bread;" i.e., the building where the Eucharist is prepared). When they stood above the church, Qwerbana realized that the enemy’s presence had caused him to forget how to recite the Mystagogia. He tried to say the words, but the enemy struck him with an iron stick and threw him into the water that coursed down to the church. Qwerbana was swept away by the water, and his body slammed down next to the church with a loud crash audible to the monks in the shrine. Just then Mary appeared. She told Qwerbana not to worry, then touched his body and healed him of the injuries caused by his fall.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, of Dabra Zamaddo worked for a certain monk, whose name was Qwǝrbana Dǝngǝl, whom she had saved before from the devouring leopard and also from a killer Arami, and whom she had kept since his youth from every difficulty, as she also did from the snare of the enemy when he grew old and his energy had waned. One day, at midnight, (the enemy) came to the old man and said to him, “Stand up, father; let us go to church, because today is New Year. People are waiting for you. Stand up; let us go”. The old man said to him, “The night is too heavy; it is still dark. How can I go?” The enemy said to him, pretending to be one of the boys of the old man’s household, “The night is over; I will also put on a torch for you”. (The enemy) made him think that he had put the light on. So the old man said, “Alright”, because the enemy had deranged his mind. He brought him out of his house and took him in the direction of the church. Soon they came to the juncture of (two) roads (one of which) would take one to the right and (the other) to the left. The one on the right leads to beneath the church, and it is near the church. The one on the left leads to above the shrine. The old man said, “Let us take the road on the right”. But the enemy said, “How can we enter (now through the front door)? For the worldly people are gathered at the door of the church. They will criticize us, saying, ‘How did they sleep until day break?’ Let us rather go over the church. We will enter the shrine by the beta lǝhem, without people seeing us”. He said this and took him by the road on the left. When they came above the church, at the watercourse, the old man remembered his habit of a long time. He used to recite the Mystagogia when he rose up from sleep until he came to church. On that day he did not re- member this prayer until he came (close) to the church, because the enemy had made him forget. The old man said in his heart, “What happened to me today, that I abandoned my prayer. He said this and (started) next (to recite it), saying, “Baʾǝta tǝmhǝrta hǝbuʾat …”.The enemy said to him, “What, other than this, your prayer, would burn me!” He said this and struck him on his neck with an iron stick, and hurled him into the watercourse. He was thrown flat down at the door of the church. Two saintly monks who were inside the shrine heard him. They thought a boulder had come down, ripped off from the top of the cliff. As they wondered, saying, “What is it that was thrown on the ground?” they immediately heard the words of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, when she said to him, “za-Qwǝrbana, za-Qwǝrbana, my son, my beloved one, the beloved of my Son, my lyre, the fiddle of my praise, do not be afraid, because nothing evil will happen to you, because I keep you”. She said this and touched his body. And he rose up as a sleeping person rises from bed and entered the shrine. Neither the strike of the enemy nor the falling flat on the ground from the cliff hurt him at all because his Lady had touched him. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
