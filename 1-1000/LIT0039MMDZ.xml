            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>King Lalibala was the godfather of his brother’s son. When the child was three, Lalibala separated him from his mother’s bosom and took him into his care. After this, the child stopped eating anything except for earth, which he only consumed on the Sabbath. The people of the country thought the boy looked healthy and beautiful, so they assumed he ate and drank whatever he wanted. Only Lalibala knew of his godson’s secret fasting. One day, while the boy was sleeping near his spiritual father, Lalibala noticed a goat tether tied around his waist. Seeing this, and reflecting on his godson’s torment, Lalibala began to weep. At that moment Mary appeared and spoke to Lalibala. She explained that righteous individuals like his godson find the kingdom of heaven by refusing to be subservient to food and drink. Comforted by Mary’s words, Lalibala abandoned his sorrow.</p>

                <ab>A miracle that Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed and revealed a secret to the meek, and kind like his God, the famous King Lalibala, whose regnal name is Gabra Masqal, regarding his son whom he begat in two ways: one is that (the child) was the son of his brother in flesh, and the other is that (King Lalibala) was (his) guardian in the Holy Spirit. He took him from the bosom of his mother and kept him with him. When he took him from the bosom of his mother, his mother was saddened because of her separation, for the child was small, just three years old. His mother’s eyes were not satiated with seeing him. As for the child, he never ate anything from the delight of this world, but earth. Even the earth, he never ate but only on Sabbaths. The people of the country said about him, “This child, the son of the king, looks like start of the sky because he eats and drinks whatever he wants”. On this (assumption), they said, “His beauty is superb”. But the child never ate anything. He tied his waist with a goat tether. No one knew his asceticism but his spiritual father. Indeed, his father knew his secret – that he did not eat anything. One day, as (the child) was sleeping with his father Lalibala, Lalibala searched the child at his waist and found his waist tied with a goat tether, but it being like linen. Lalibala lamented and cried when he saw the torment the child was under. At that moment, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, came and appeared to Lalibala [and said to him], “Why do you cry and break the heart of the child?” And she made a point next, saying to him, “Regarding the Kingdom of my Son, people do not find it being subservient to food and drink. Only the righteous find it when their body becomes like a dried bark of a tree and like the green mallow of the time of drought, due to too much fasting, repeated prostration to the ground, and too much starvation and thirst. People find it only this way”. Saying this, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, made Lalibala abandon his sorrow. Us, too, may she save by her prayer from the jaw of the lion and the wolf forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
