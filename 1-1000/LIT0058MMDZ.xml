            <abstract>
                <p>On the twentieth of Hedar (around November 25), construction began on a new church, but the water in that place soon dried up. They sought water at a nearby spring, but that too had dried up, and they lacked a horse to carry water from a more distant river. When the clergy were on the verge of stopping construction, Mary intervened by establishing a new spring, just as her infant son had done in Egypt. The people collected the water while praising God and thanking Mary.</p>

             <ab>A miracle [performed] by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, may her prayer and blessing be with her servant forever and ever and ever, amen.
On the twentieth of Hedar one year, the construction of a church was started.
However, the drinking water had dried up.
Due to this lack of water, the people on that mountain were struggling.
So, at night, they raced [to another place] to draw water because they did not have any.
However, that place’s [spring]water bubbled up only a little, just enough to fill five water jars.
[They needed more] but couldn’t find a horse that could carry water from a distant river.
The clergy were distressed about the [halted] construction.
As for Our Lady, she wanted to show her power to bring forth water—just as her son had brought forth water for Israel from a dry stone, praise to the Father.1 So she established a [new] spring from which could be drawn water for one hundred water jars, just like a big flowing river.
After they had finished collecting water [from the insufficient spring,] while they were traveling back carrying that water, they heard [the burbling of] water, which sounded like it was pouring out jar after jar, overflowing from the pit [of the stone in which Our Lady Mary had created the spring].
Having seen this, the mountain’s people praised God and gave thanks to Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayers and her blessings be with her servant forever and ever, amen.</ab>
