            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>In Semrata Ab there lived a woman named Walatta Negest, who loved Mary and loyally attended a church built in her name. One day Walatta Negest told Mary that she needed to move to another country. She asked Mary to accompany her on this journey and keep her safe. Unbeknownst to Walatta Negest, the new country was located right next to an Arami community. A few days after she arrived she went out to work the harvest in the farm fields. As she and other Christians were harvesting, the Arami came. The others fled, but Walatta Negest could not run, so she remained with her cattle. The Arami took the cows as booty, but when they tried to take Walatta Negest captive as well, Mary prevented them. The Arami repeatedly returned to the field to capture Walatta Negest, but they never succeeded and finally gave up. Thus was Walatta Negest safe in her new country, and when she eventually returned to Semrata Ab she told the people there all about what Mary had done for her.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed to the monk for whom she brought birds and arranged his house: He had disciples who attended him. His cell was near the church of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. Above it, there is a big cliff whose top is far for the eye. It has no path that would take one up (to the top) and bring one down. Its height is raised very high, and its breadth is wide, a walk of half a day. At the top of the cliff, there is the farm field which the disciples worked. Their behavior was very good. And Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, loved them very much, seeing the beautiful art of their (good) deeds. Due to her too much love (for them, she decided) to give them respite from the hardship of the road, because they had toiled too much in going round the cliff until they came to their farm field. When the tender-hearted Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, saw on one hand their devotion to serving in her church and on the other to working the farm field of their teacher with humility and love, she, therefore, authorized them and made them to be like the angels of God. When they went out toward their farm field, they walked up on the cliff, and when they returned toward their home, they went down on the cliff without using a rope, like Dabra Damo, as a means of ascending and descending the cliff. They did not make a ladder either as other people do as a means for ascending and descending a mount or cliff. These holy men did not think of such means because they were given wings from the Creator and Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. With the wings, they went out to the field and came back along the middle of the cliff. One day, as they worked their farm field, the enemy shot its arrow and stung the heart of one of the monks with the love of money: As he was working, he found a needle. (The enemy) brought him the thought of not revealing it to his brothers, keeping it by his waist. He placed it there as (the enemy) instructed him to, because the enemy had started to make him accustomed to quibbling with people. Mar Isaac says, “Keep yourself from minor things, lest you fall from big things”. Therefore, the enemy tested him with a needle, to cut him off from the membership in the body of the saints. On that day, in the evening, they came to the edge of the cliff. His brothers went down to their home as they were used to. But the owner of the needle remained at the top of the cliff. His brothers said to him, “Why are you not coming?” He said to them, “Come, I will inform you”. When they went, he said to them, “Look at my disgrace. Because of this needle, I went down from being an angel to being below people. But (please) forgive my sin and ask Our Lady to restore me to you as she returned the angel to his former status because of the prayer of Abba Samuel of Qalamun. (Please) pray to the Lady of us all. And think about this sin and keep it in your heart so that it may be an admonition and a lesson for you, and (to be evidence) that what John Chrysostom has said is true. For he has said that there is no small or big sin. All keep one far from God. Just do not sin”. When the brothers heard this, they prayed to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. And on her part, she accepted their prayer and made him as before, and restored him to his brothers. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Walatta Sara [forever and ever. Amen].</ab>
