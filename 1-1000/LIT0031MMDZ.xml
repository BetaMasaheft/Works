            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>Mahdara Kresto was a monk who lived at Dabra Zamaddo and who loyally served Mary. The people of Dabra Zamaddo appointed Mahdara Kresto as their new abbot, and he ably upheld the church’s orders and laws. But there came a day when Mahdara Kresto decided to step down from his office. When the people begged him to stay, he responded: “when the time in office is prolonged, negligence will prevail.” As Mahdara Kresto grew old and began to prepare his grave far from the church, Mary sent a messenger to ask him why he dug outside the shrine. Mahdara Kresto, who believed himself a sinner, asked why he should be buried in the shrine. But the messenger promised that the monk would have his final rest there. After Mahdara Kresto finished his labors, he went on to live for many years with a childlike innocence. When he died, other monks brought his body to the shrine and, at Mary’s direction, buried him to the right of the altar.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Dabra Zamaddo: There was a certain monk whose name was Mahdara Krǝstos who loved Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, and who served in her church. When they appointed him bishop for her church, he upheld its orders and laws, and pleased the people of her household. He even left his office on his own volition, not demoted but while people begged him, saying, “Do not leave your office, because you please both God and people”. But he said to them, “(Please) let me go; when the time in office is prolonged, negligence will prevail. At that time man quarrels with his Creator”. He said this, and left his office. When (the monk) grew old, he thought of his passing away and started digging his grave outside the church, very far from the church. Since Our Lady does not forget her love to whoever loves her in faith, at that time, she sent him a missive, saying to him, “Why do you dig outside? Will you not be buried inside the shrine?” The man said, “How would I be buried inside the shrine when I am a sinner and filthy? How would I be buried in the dwelling of my Lords?” He said this and persisted in digging. The messenger of Our Lady Mary said to him, “Your toil (in digging) will be in vain”. Next, he made a prophecy to follow: “If you rest before me, I will bury you inside the shrine, where My Lady has shown me. And if I die before you, she herself would know”. The monk finished what he started, and lived many years. He became like children in innocence. He came to a state he did not distinguish good from bad. He forgot even fasting and prayer, lest he put people under excommunication, saying, “Bury me where I have built (my grave)”. When he rested, brothers buried him inside the shrine, on the right of the altar, because Our Lady had directed earlier there the man whom she sent, saying to him, “Why will you be buried far from me? For you are my beloved one”. Her words were fulfilled as she had told him. O brothers, see the amount of her love! Whether one served her a little or loved her much, if his mind went astray, she will bring him back to the inner side of her house. And if one despises her words a bit, and disregards her precepts, she will keep him far from her precinct and blessing. O Our Lady, may your prayer and blessing keep us, the children of your household; And make us partake in the banquet of your Son. And may your sojourn in Qwǝsqwam be a guardian to us. Forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
