                <p>A posthumous Miracle of Mary. Mahdara Maryam lived next door to a church of Mary and devoted herself completely to the Holy Virgin. In addition to her religious devotions Mahdara Maryam also tended fields. Every year she alternated between planting wheat and barley, the harvests from which she made bread and beer for the clergy and the poor. One year Mahdara Maryam’s son asked to take over the farm and prepare for the feast of the Dormition. But once he had control of the fields, he decided not prepare for the feast, and when the time for celebration arrived, he disappeared. When she heard about her son’s actions, Mahdara Maryam put on the clothing she wore for Communion, climbed into bed, and called on Mary to come take her away. On the day of the feast the clergy arrived at the church, but Mahdara Maryam was not there. The decided to check on her, since she was never absent from church. They went to her house and found that she had died in her bed.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked for this chosen (woman) when she was living where she had shown her within her precinct. She lived keeping the ordinance of the house of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. The case of the husband of the woman was closed earlier, as she had given him up. She did not think of him again, and her children had settled where Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, had showed them. (Mary) was keeping them day and night because they were the children of her beloved one. But the chosen one did not think of them because she had held fast to the word of her Creator who has said, “Whoever has not abandoned the whole world for my sake and the sake of my Gospel …”. Therefore, Mahdara Maryam abandoned her husband and children, and only served Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. And of her farm fields, she chose the best one whose crop would be ready in the month of Sane and whose grain would be 40 asfaridat. She would sow it wheat one year and barley another year. From this she would not take a single seed, but added to it. When (the crop) was wheat she would use it for bread and fetch barley for beer from elsewhere. When it was barley she would use it for beer and for bread she would think of another (source) for wheat. She did all this for the feast of Assumption. Starting from Easter Eve to the end of Fasika, she would please the clergy and the poor with food and drink. After she had celebrated (Mary’s) memorial (of Assumption) many years, her older son begged her to give him this farm field and to prepare the feast. She allowed him to make the memorial because of his great pressure. When she gave (it) to him, he abolished the preparation for the feast. At noon time on the eve of the feast day, people told her, saying, “Your son has disappeared; he is hidden from people; and the commemoration has not been thought about”. When she heard about the suspension of the feast, she went home, brought out her clothes she wears for the Communion, clothed herself (with them), stepped into her bed and called upon Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, “O Yes-Sayer! Say, ‘Yes’ to me. Come, (and) take me away, lest I see the face of the son who abolished the commemoration of the feast of Assumption”. She said this and slept, having stretched her legs straight on the bed. When the clergy gathered into church and missed her, they went (to her house), saying to each other, “How did she stay away on the feast day, she who would not interrupt going to church on normal days and was never absent from her standing place?” When they arrived, they asked the people of her household, saying, “What happened to the lady?” The people of her household replied to them, saying: “‘Come, My Lady, to take me away, lest I see the face of my disgraceful son who has abolished your feast.’ She said this at noon and slept. Her voice has not been heard after she said these words at noon”. When they (tried) to wake her up, she was found dead, as her husband had been a witness, when she sent a missive to him, saying, “After this, I shall not see your face”. At that time, he had cried bitterly because her word was one. Our Lady, too, took her, as she ordered her because she knew her mind, and there would be no change in her words. See this miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked! If those who are caught by severe illness ask her for life, she would raise them up immediately after they had come close to dying. And if they ask her for passing away, she would take them away immediately. She does all this because of her love for people. Other desire she has none. This woman gave an order to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, because she knew that she loved her very much. And Our Lady took her immediately. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.   </ab>
