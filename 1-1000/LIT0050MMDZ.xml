            <abstract>
                <p>A wealthy governor’s official named Yoseph is tasked with ensuring a prisoner does not escape. While guarding the prisoner, Yoseph hosted a feast to honor Mary’s Dormition. Yoseph offered the man food. However, the prisoner refused to eat, since his shackles were too tight, and a log tied around his neck caused too much pain. Yoseph said he would untie the log if the prisoner promised Mary he would not escape, under punishment of her wrath. Despite making the oath, the prisoner escaped, causing Yoseph much fear and anger. After Yoseph prayed to Mary, the escaped prisoner was recaptured and imprisoned under harsher conditions.</p>

             <ab>The miracle [performed] by Our Lady, the Holy Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, may her prayer and blessing be with us forever and ever, amen.
A man named Yoseph was an official of a governor.
The governor loved him very much.
[One day,] the governor caught an enemy of his and imprisoned him.
He said to Yoseph his official, “Take him and watch him. Make sure he doesn’t escape from your hands!”
Yoseph took the prisoner to his house and began watching him.
However, Yoseph wanted to observe the feast of Our Lady Mary’s assumption, so he prepared a feast and gathered all his family and his neighbors, men and women.
He presented the food to them, and they ate.
Meanwhile, the prisoner was groaning because of the tight shackles on his hands and feet. His neck was tied with a rope fastened to a log. He was groaning in pain.
The rich man [Yoseph] saw the prisoner[’s suffering] and gave him food to eat.
But the prisoner did not eat.
Yoseph asked him, “Why aren’t you eating?”
The prisoner replied, “Can’t you see the pain I am in?!”
After the prisoner said this, Yoseph wanted to give him a little relief. In front of [Yoseph’s house] was a church built in the name of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-Fold Virgin.
So, Yoseph said to the prisoner, “Vow in Mary’s name that you won’t try to fool me and escape. [If you escape,] my lord will be angry with me. Now, I will give you a little relief.”
The prisoner said, “Good. Let it be as you say.”
Yoseph untied [the rope that tied] the log to his neck. Then, the prisoner ate his fill, although Yoseph did not loosen the shackles on his hands and feet.
What did this prisoner do next?
He melted the shackles in the fire and, slipping out, he escaped at night. Yoseph and his household had no idea how he had escaped.
When Yoseph learned of the prisoner’s escape, he screamed and cried. He prayed, “Our dear Lady Mary, I take refuge in you. Blind that prisoner’s eyes and return him to my hand. For he vowed in your name [not to escape].”
Now, that prisoner did not know about Mary’s miraculous power. He thought he had escaped to a far region but, when he was running in the night, he only circled back to where he had been.
[Upon his return to Yoseph], the man was given even worse imprisonment than he had had before.
The sinners in Sheol also try to escape, when they are taken out of Sheol on Friday evenings. They run away and do not rest for they think that they can escape the fire. But, around their necks is a fiery chain they do not notice.
That prisoner did not know about the miraculous power of Our Lady Mary, the Holy Two-Fold Virgin, and so he was returned [to prison] in shame and ignominy.
Listen my dear brothers, she always consoles anyone who trusts in her and calls on her name. She saves them from their suffering.
May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Werede Qal, forever and ever. Amen</ab>
