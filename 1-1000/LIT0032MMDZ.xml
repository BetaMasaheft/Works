            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>Maba'a Seyon lived in Semrata Ab. One day, a woman came to Maba'a Seyon and asked him to take her baby as a servant. Maba'a Seyon reluctantly accepted this child, who was very sick and vomited what looked like charcoal and scorpions. One night, after the child had recovered from his illness, there was a terrible fire. The adults escaped the house, but two children remained inside, including the child Maba'a Seyon had taken on as a servant. The next morning, the people of the country found that though one child had burned to ash, Maba'a Seyon’s servant had miraculously survived thanks to Mary. Elsewhere in the same country there was a beautiful church surrounded by tall trees. The trees blocked the sun in the dry season, and in the wet season they dripped water and shed leaves onto the church, eroding its walls. The people did not want to upset Mary by cutting the trees down, so they left them alone. But Mary, who loved her people, caused a fire to burn down the offending trees. The fire grew so intense that the people worried it would destroy the church as well. But when the fire cleared they found the church still standing, with its thatch roof miraculously intact.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at a church built in her name in the country of sǝmrata Ab: Listen, my brothers! Let us tell you the miracle she worked, just as her Son worked for his beloved Mabaʾa tsǝyon. (At that time) when a woman came to (Mabaʾa tsǝyon), carrying her sick child on her back, and said to him, “Take this child and heal him by your prayer, and let him be your servant”, he said to her, “I myself am a servant of My Lord. How do I accept a servant? But give him to his Lord, the Savior of the World”. The woman heard and said, “Let it be as you said”. At that time he put in (the child’s) mouth crumbs from (the food prepared for) the memorial of the Savior of the World. At that moment, (the child) vomited what looked like charcoal and scorpions. After that, when he recovered (from vomiting), he became well. One day, as he and his brother were asleep in one bed, embracing each other, both covered with one blanket, the house was on fire at midnight. Those who heard went out and fled from the fire. The (two) children remained – because sleep had killed them – because they did not hear. The next morning, the people of the country gathered with the father (of the children), and cleared the (other) ash to bury their ash. They found them; they found the trust of Our Savior alive, but the second was found being ash. Look at this miracle! Our Lady Mary, too, showed (a similar miracle) in her church which we described earlier, saying, “The construction of the church and its foundation were beautiful”. Its trees were many, very dense and tall, higher than the church (building). Because of their excessive height, they prevented the sun from entering the fence of the church. People who came to church said to each other, “If we cut the branches of the trees, Our Lady will be angry with us. And if we leave them so, when they drip water in the season of Kramt, they would wear out the church before its time. And in the season of hagay, every leaf of the trees comes down on the church. This (too) would wear it out. We, too, when we come out after service, could not find the sun inside the fence. We do not find sun, unless we go far outside the fence”. They lived on saying (so) to each other. And Our Lady Mary, as she is a lover of people, caused fire to start in the field, far from the church, to fulfill (people’s) wish and to reveal the power of her miracle. This Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God – because she is saddened when people are saddened and hears them quickly when they pray to her – brought the fire quickly to her precinct. It met with its trees. Every tree present in the compound of the church was burnt down. The charcoal came down on the church, and the flame was repeatedly moving hither and thither above the church. The people of the country wailed from far, saying, “How did you do (so), Our Lady? Because of our sin, you burnt down your own church and the tabot named after your name. How did you put your own church on fire while all your property is in it?” Saying so, they spent the night, starting at three in the afternoon until morning, and the trees burning. In the morning, people came close to see the condition of the church; they found it well. None of her properties was burnt save for the trees which prevented the sun, which were like a canopy over the church and would wear it out by their drips before its time. As for the charcoal which was cut from the trees and dropped on the church, its ash was found becoming a pile. When they cleared the ash, they found the straw (of the roof) well. Even its color was not changed, not to speak of it being burnt. See this miracle! While fire burns wet trunks, it does not touch dry grass when the power of Our Lady prevents it. May your prayer and petition save us, too – as they saved your church from the fire – From the love of the world, the snare, Which looks permanent, although it is like a shadow. Forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
