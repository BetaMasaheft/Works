            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>When Walda Yohannes (later known as Abbuna Sinodos) was named the new keeper of the law at Dabra Zamaddo, he noticed that water poured into the grotto and endangered the church. He decided to pave the mouth of the grotto and divert the water’s flow, and he went in search of materials for this purpose. Some people informed him of a large hab tree standing on top of the mountain, so he went there to cut it down. But when Walda Yohannes arrived, people had gathered there to tell him that he would have to kill them first if he wanted to fell the tree. In sadness he returned home, where he prayed to Mary. He said the people of the country were crooked, and he wondered why they would not let the tree be cut down to benefit Mary’s church. Mary heard Walda Yohannes’s words, and she spent three days in silence. After observing the people’s stubbornness and lack of humility she split the tree into three parts. With the tree destroyed, the people allowed Walda Yohannes to use the wood. Mary moved the tree from the mountaintop to the grotto. But Walda Yohannes realized that the wood pieces were unusable, as they had not been cut peacefully.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked at Dabra Zamaddo for Abuna Sinodos who was called Walda Yohannǝs when he was appointed keeper and legislator of the law of Dabra Zamaddo: The water that came down on the grotto used to trouble the church. It troubled it very much, starting with the beginning of the Kramt until the month of Maskaram. At other months, too, it would trouble it if it rained. When Abuna Walda Yohannǝs saw this during the time of his tenure, he wanted to improve the way the water streamed and to build a pavement at the mouth of the grotto. He searched for wood that would go on par with the pavement. People reported to him, saying, “There is a hab tree at the top of the mountain that can be good for this construction”. Hearing this, Abuna Sinodos went with many people to cut the hab tree. When the people of the country heard that he went to cut the hab tree, they came together and went to the tree. They found our father having arrived there. They said to him, “Unless you first kill us, we will neither be quiet nor let you cut it”. Abuna Walda Yohannǝs said to them, “Why do you think evil? Is not our church for us all as well? And is it not the abode of Our Lady Mary? How did the enemy make you think of an evil matter? Leave this matter”. Those who opposed him said to him, “Your words are not sweet to us. As for leaving, you leave, (not we). If you want to cut it, kill us first. But while we see, we will not let you cut it”. When Walda Yohannǝs heard these, their evil words, he was very sad. He said (to himself), “If I insist on cutting it, these people will clash with my people. And people could die because of this”. He said this, and having counseled with himself, he abandoned cutting the tree and left for home, saddened and distressed. See this humility of this father, and meekness of his heart and his love for people! He did not want to cut it by force. Even though he was the ruler of these people and a huge host had followed him, he chose to abandon cutting the tree. He only said to Our Lady, “See the crooked- ness of these people! What does that tree in the wilderness benefit them? Would it not be better for them, if your house was constructed?” As for Our Lady, she heard and kept silent (for the moment). She was patient for three days. When she saw these people’s stubbornness of the heart – that they neither humbled themselves nor turned from their wicked counsel – despite the fact that their father exhibited meekness, and their ruler humbled himself, she made the tree fall from its root and be divided it into three parts, without a human hand touching it. When people heard (it), they brought to Abuna Sinodos the good news of the fall of the tree from its root. And those people who prevented its cutting humbled themselves after its fall from its root, (humility) void of praise. They said to Abuna Walda Yohannǝs, “Do what you want to do”. He said, disappointed in his heart, “This praise, after the fall of the tree from its root, is not for people but for God and his Bearer, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God”. As she moved (the church of) Dabra ʿƎqwana, she moved the tree in the same fashion. But she did not damage the foundation (of the church) of Dabra ʿƎqwana when she moved it; she only took it from place to place; and there, she kept it firmly as before. But her moving of this tree was not for a good (reason) but for its destruction. And she cut it into such (useless) parts. And its end was not good. She made the tree fall from its root to show her power, because of the diligence and righteousness (of Abuna Sinodos) and his servitude to Our Lady Mary. Its end was not good also because of the crookedness of the people, because ruse destroys the straight path. And (the abbot) could not improve this building (using) the tree because its cutting was not done peacefully (but only) because he loved (Mary) and because of the straight- ness of his mind. She saw his love for her, and it moved it from its place; but because of the crookedness of the people, she did not accept it. And so its end was not good. If the beginning (of anything) is not with love, its end will not be good. See this miracle which Our Lady Mary worked! Lest people say about her, “She does not help her beloved ones”, she removed (the tree) from its place to show her love to Abuna Sinodos. And lest the people who quarrelled before say, “She is a lover of money”, she (arranged) that (her) people would not cut it. Therefore, the end (of the tree) was not good. May her prayer and her blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
