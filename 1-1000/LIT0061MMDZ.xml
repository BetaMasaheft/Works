             <ab>A Miracle Our Lady Mary, Holy Two Fold Virgin, Mother of God, performed. May her prayer and blessings be with her servant Haile Gabriel forever and ever. Amen.
There was a poor widow who observed Our Lady Mary’s memorial. She did not have any possessions except for one sheep. She earned her nourishment by selling this sheep’s wool. The woman had a neighbor named Yaeqob. He stole the sheep, killed it and consumed it. In the evening, the widow went to the field, where all the sheep stayed during the day, to bring her sheep home. But, she couldn’t find the sheep.
She cried to Our Lady Mary saying, “My dear Lady Mary, have you abandoned me?! I lost my sheep! I won’t be able to celebrate your memorial. I am going to die of hunger! I am lost!” 
Then, she went to the thief Yaeqob and said, “Did you take my sheep?” 
He replied, “I neither took nor saw your sheep.” 
She said, “Do you come to Our Lady Mary’s church and swear holding the Virgin’s icon? I trust in her prayer!”
He [agreed] and went to Our Lady Mary’s church. A priest said to the thief, “Why did you come?”
The thief replied, “I want to swear on my health!”
Then, he began to swear holding Our Lady’s icon. But, before he finishes his swearing, he was hung up in the air grunting like a pig. 
The people became terrified. He confessed all his sins before all the people and said, “My Lady Mary, have mercy on me! I will compensate the woman!” 
Our Lady forgave the thief. He became a generous and good man. [Seeing his behavioral change] the people praised Our Lady Mary. May her prayer and blessings be with her servant Haila Gabriel forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
