            <abstract>
                <p>A non-Christian man from Wandige had a daughter who was blind. He went to the church of Mary, and he asked her to correct his daughter’s blindness. In exchange, he promised to give her one cow from his daughter’s dowry. Mary granted his wish. Later, when his daughter married, the man offered the cow to her new husband, and his daughter’s blindness returned. Perturbed, the man returned to the church. He prayed for Mary’s forgiveness, and his daughter’s eyesight returned once more. There was a second father, whose daughter also suffered from blindness. When he heard of the miracle granted to the first father, he made the same oath to Mary. He pledged a cow from his daughter’s dowry, and in exchange Mary granted her eyesight. Like the first father, the second betrayed his pledge by giving the cow to his daughter’s husband. When her blindness returned, the second father begged Mary’s pardon. However, she refused to forgive him.</p>

             <ab>[This is] a miracle [performed by] Our Holy Lady Mary, the Two-Fold Virgin, the compassionate, the Mother of Mercy, the Mother of God.
She is the light of the blind,
the cane of the lame,
the strength of the weak and the distressed,
the hearing of the deaf,
the voice of the mute,
the liberator of the imprisoned,
Mary, the Mother of Light!
May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Walda Sellase, forever and ever. Amen.
This is a miracle Our Lady Mary performed.
Listen, dear children of the church,
children of light, children of Our Lady,
the Holy Virgin Mary, the Mother of Light,
you who love her and believe in her miracles.
Love her, that she might love you.
Praise her, that she might praise you.
Embrace her, that she might embrace you.
Carry her, so that she might carry you.
Call her, so that she might answer you.
Seek her, so that you might find her.
Ask her, so that she might give to you.
Approach her, so that she might approach you.
Rely on her saving [power] and deliverance!
Don’t be like the wicked people who are in our country [of Ethiopia], into whose hearts Satan has breathed and into whose mouths he has defecated. Their Father is Satan.
And, that’s not because they don’t know the Scriptures. Rather, it’s because they want to machinate against Our Lady and please their Father Satan.
They [suspiciously] ask, “How can Mary save a person who is a sinner?”
But, we believe [in her power] and so we say that the entire creation will be saved through her prayer! This is because the Lord made her a promise that he will never break. The Lord said to her, “I will show mercy to anyone who commemorates you, calls upon your name, trusts in your prayer, builds your church, or [even just] gives cold water to a thirsty person in your name.”
My dear brothers, how great is the madness of those who say, “she doesn’t save”!
I am terrified because of this!
When my heart remembers this madness, it trembles!
May the Lord wipe them from the face of the earth with dreadful disasters!
May He throw them into the fires of hell, forever and ever! Amen.
You with a blind heart! Listen to what Our Lord said, he who is slow to anger and abounding in limitless mercy. He gave us the following reason to hope for salvation, saying in the Gospel of Matthew, “Truly, I say to you, anyone who gives [even just] a cup of cold water to these little ones in my name or in the name of my disciples, will not lose his reward.”
You cursed one! You also [foolishly] say, opposing Mary, “Isn’t she [human] like us? If we become pure, we will be like her.”
You cursed one! How are you going to achieve the purity of the Virgin Mary, who is pure in her mind and her body? From Adam until today, no one but Mary has been able to have a purity that could save us.
You windbag! You arrogant one! Where will you achieve anything like the purity of Mary? Even if you become pure in body, will you be able to have a pure mind? What is this [madness]? Aren’t you a human being who chugs sin like water? And you dare to say, “I will match Mary in purity!”? Will you be able to save like her?
Come, let me show you how Mary’s miracles and wonders save.
Aside from Mary, who gave birth to the whole world’s creator while maintaining her two-fold virginity, are others—the prophets, the apostles, the saints, and the martyrs—who can save through their prayer.
In addition, listen to what the Lord says to his apostles, “Anyone who believes in your prayer, celebrates your memorial, and commissions the book of your life and struggles to be written, will march in victory with you on the Last Day.”
You cursed one! You say in your heart, “I will inherit the heavenly kingdom because of [my] toil.” Are you greater than David, God’s beloved? God said about David, in His own words,
“I have found David, my servant.
I have anointed him with holy anointment.
My hand helps him, my arm establishes him.
No enemy shall prevail against him.
Violence’s children shall not make him suffer.
I will cut his enemies down before him, and
I will annihilate his enemies.
My mercy and righteousness is with him.
In my name, his horn shall be raised high.
I will establish his hand over the sea.
and his right hand over the rivers.
David says to me, ‘You are my Father, my God, my helper, my salvation.’
I shall make David my first born.
He is more exalted than any other earthly king.
I will always be merciful to him.
He is faithful to my promise [to him].
I will make his line [continue] forever.
His throne will last as long as the heavens.
If his children abandon my law, and do not follow it,
according to my judgment,
or if they pollute my established order,
and do not keep my commandments,
I will punish their sin with a rod,
and their transgressions with flogging.
But, I will not withhold my mercy from them.
I will not violate my truth.
I will not defile my promise.
I will not falsify my words.
I vowed by my holy one that I shall not lie to David.
His line shall live forever.
His throne shall be like the sun in front of me.
It is established as long as the moon.”
Even though David had all these assurances, he did not stop fearing the Lord, remembering his sin. For a sinless human being cannot be found among human beings.
Because of this [fact], David called out to the Lord saying, “If you count up sin, Lord, Lord, who can stand before you.” In addition, regarding human sin, David says, “In my alarm, I said, ‘All people are liars!’”
David said all this, [inspired] by the Holy Spirit.
Now, [cursed one,] you say, “I will be saved by my own works. No human being can be saved by Mary’s petition!”
What kind of mouth do you have that dares to say such a terrible thing?!
You cursed one!
You ugly one!
You ruined one!
You Devil’s firstborn!
May God seal shut your mouth and slam shut your throat with his wrath, as He shut Gog and Magog!
May He obliterate your teaching from the face of the earth, just as He obliterated Sodom and Gomorrah with the hand of wrath!
May the earth open her mouth and swallow you [alive], as she swallowed Dathan and Abiram!
May Hell, your mother, carry you on her back of torment, forever and ever! Amen.
Now, let’s return to our topic, a miracle of Our Holy Lady Mary, the Pure Virgin, from which we digressed because of [our] anger and to reprimand the forgetful regarding her exaltation [above all], her helpful might, and the beauty of her deliverance, which benefits the righteous and saves the sinners. Mary, the Mother of the Savior!
A pagan man in a town called Wendeggay had a daughter who was blind. He said to himself, “I will go to Mary’s church and ask if she will heal my daughter’s eyes.”
So, he went with his daughter and reached Our Lady the Virgin Mary’s Church.
While knocking at her door, he said, “My dear Lady, if you can, heal my daughter’s eyes. For I have heard of your wonders, [so, please] heal my daughter. If you heal her, I will give you a cow as a gift from her bride-wealth.”
As he was saying this, his daughter’s eyes opened.
He returned home celebrating and rejoicing.
[When] the people saw [this miracle,] they thanked and praised our Lady Mary, the Mother of Mercy, the Compassionate One, with new praise.
Not long after that, the man arranged a betrothal for his daughter.
After taking [the bride-wealth, however,] he [and his family] went to another town so that people would not know who he was and would not be able to say that he had lied when he had vowed to give a cow to our Lady Mary.
[Soon after they moved, his daughter’s] eyes darkened, and she became blind again.
When he saw this sign, he was terrified. He [quickly] returned to Wendeggay, bringing his daughter and the cow he had vowed to give [to Mary,] to the church of the Virgin.
He said, “My dear Lady Mary, I have sinned and treated you like a fool. Look, here is what I vowed to you[, the cow]. Dear Compassionate One, have compassion on me and my daughter.”
As he was saying this, his daughter’s eyes opened.
[Now,] another man[, a Christian,] heard of this miracle that our Lady Mary had performed.
That man went [to the same church] and he [too] brought his blind daughter and said, “My Lady, heal my daughter as you healed the daughter of [Mr.] So-and-So. I also will give you a cow from her bride-wealth.”
Immediately, his daughter’s eyes opened.
After a little while, he too arranged a betrothal for his daughter and he too went to another town to avoid giving Mary what he had vowed. There too, his daughter’s eyes darkened.
He immediately returned to Wendeggay with what he had vowed and knocked on [Mary’s] door. He begged her, saying, “My dear Lady Mary, heal my daughter. Look, here is what I vowed to you.”
However, Mary did not accept [his repentance] for he did it intentionally.
May Our Lady Mary’s prayer and supplication be with us, bless us, and blot out our sins forever and ever. Amen.
We have found [elsewhere that] which says, “Truly, Mary will come and bless anyone who reads this book during Our Lady Mary’s feast and on the Christian Sabbath with her holy and immaculate hand.” Amen.</ab>
