            <creation>This story, with the short title "Healing of the Two-Faced Egyptian," is very old: the earliest PEMM manuscript* in which this story appears is from around <date>1404</date>.Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC3010Ethiop">Ethiopia</placeName></creation>

                <p>In Egypt, Mary came upon a man who had two faces. He asked her to heal him, and when she touched him, he instantly had the face of an ordinary person. When she asked him about the source of his affliction, he quoted a psalm that said, “Sinners are known from the womb.” Mary then told the man to repent for his sins, and he did so. He then returned home, and his people, awestruck, asked him how he’d been healed. When he told them, they gathered all those in the community with disabilities and diseases and went to see Mary. She healed them all.</p>

             <ab>Mary’s miracle. May the Lord bestow on us her blessings and her prayers. Amen.
Our Lady went to Egypt and found a man who had two faces. [When he saw Our Lady], he looked to her and begged her [to heal him].
She blessed him. Immediately, his two faces became one like other humans.
She asked him, “Why did this happen to you?”
[He replied,] didn’t you hear what [the bible] says: ‘Sinners are known from the womb. They erred and spoke lies beginning from the womb.’”1
Mary said, “The Lord knows what is in the human heart; everything hidden or unhidden.” She added, “Go. Repent and ask [God to forgive you].”
He said, “[I beg the Lord to forgive me] for the sake of your Queenship and your Majesty—
"For the sake of the power that was given to you to carry the Living Fire in your womb;
"For the sake of your wonderful and marvelous birthing without unsealing your virginity’s gates, you embraced the Blazing Fire in your arms;
"For the sake of your lap on which you put [the Blazing Fire];
"For the sake of your sweet-smelling lips, which kissed the Blazing Fire;
"For the sake of your breasts, which nourished with milk the all-nourishing [God];
"For the sake of your exile, [when they exiled you] from town to town under persecution;
"For the sake of your feet;
"For the sake of your hunger and thirst day and night, being scorched by the sun’s heat and frozen by the night’s cold. Crying without rest, there was no one to console you;
"For the sake of the sadness you experienced in the wilderness because of bandits, when they took [your clothes], your son’s clothes, and the clothes of those who were with you.
"My dear Lady, the Mother of Joy, pray for me, your maidservant Batra Aron.”
That man returned to the lowland region and told his relatives what Mary did for him. His relatives were filled with awe.
They said, “What power healed you?”
He replied, “I found Moses’s sister traveling in Egypt. I begged her.
"She said, ‘Why did this happen to you?’
"I replied, ‘Didn’t you hear what [the Bible] says, “Sinners are known from the womb. They erred and spoke lies beginning from the womb.”’
"She raised her hand and blessed me. I became like everybody else. Right away I began to go around and tell Mary’s greatness and miracles.”
His relatives said, “Take us. Let us go to Mary to participate in her blessings.”
Some of the people were paralyzed. Some others had stiff legs. Some were unable to speak. Some were blind. Some had leprosy. They [all] went to receive Mary’s blessings.
They begged her, saying, “We came [after] hearing our brother’s news. As you did for him, heal us from our diseases, for we have come to you. Some of us have withered hands. Some of us are paralyzed. Some of us are deaf. We came to you, Dear Intercessor of Mercy, Bearer of Joy; intercede for us with your son. You are Moses’s sister, David’s daughter, Aron’s vase, Habakkuk’s prophecy.”
She prayed and asked her only begotten son, “I thank you, Lord my God, who healed the sick and saved Ananiah, Azariah, and Mishael.2 Save these sick people. You made the mute speak and the deaf hear; you straightened withered arms,3 healed the legs of the paralyzed and made them run, saved Peter’s mother–in-law from her fever,4 and healed the woman who was bleeding.5 As then, save these sick people. I ask and entreat you, my Lord God. Have mercy on them and forgive these sick people who came to me.”
All the sick people were healed and went back home [safely] by Mary’s prayer.
My dear Lady, the Mother of my Lord, I beg you, for the sake of your tears which flowed on your son’s face—glory to you, glory to your son—to forgive, have mercy, have compassion, and absolve your maidservant Batra Aron’s sin forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
