            <abstract>
                <p>When Qwerbana Dengel reached school age, his parents engaged a teacher for him. He memorized the hymn (malke') of Mary, and for years he sang the hymn everywhere he went. Everyone knew him by his tendency to shout Mary’s name. The Arami who lived in the neighborhood hated the boy’s singing, so they planned to kill him. They followed Qwerbana Dengel, intending to ambush him when he was cutting wood. But even though they could clearly hear him sing the hymn to Mary, they could not find him, since the Holy Virgin hid him from their eyes.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, worked on this child: When he grew up and reached the age of going to school, (his parents) gave him to a teacher. As he learned, he memorized the malkǝʿ of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. Having memorized it, he never recited it in silence, but by shouting loudly and in singing, from its beginning to its end. Just as the clergy perform it in church, he, too, would perform it everywhere, shouting it loudly. Wherever he went he would be identified by his shouting, when he would say, “Salam, salam”. He never rested from calling her name loudly from the time he went out to the field in the morning (for work) until he came back (in the evening). As many years passed, everyone knew his manner through his shouting loudly. There were Arami in his neighborhood; these happened to look for him to kill him. When he cut wood they would follow him, but they could not find him. When he sat down, putting (the pieces of) wood together to tie them, they would encircle him. When they heard his loud shouting, they would say to each other, “What is this? Does he howl from underground? Lest we say he is in the sphere, his voice is heard (here) from the time he goes out to the field until he comes back”. He would never keep quiet from shouting, and the Arami would never rest from looking for him. (Only) evening would separate the two. The Arami would go back to their region and tell everyone what they had seen and heard. And when they would meet any one of the Christians, they would inquire into the matter of the shouting, “What is there in your region whose shouting looks like that of a human being, but his body is not visible to the eye? He does not do his shouting in only one place either, but he moves round hither and thither. And we would follow him by hearing his voice, thinking we would find him. When he rests, too, we would search for him diligently. At that moment, his status would not be known. (That is,) his status would not be known, whether he was under- ground or above ground. But his shouting would go on very long. And we would toil much, thinking we would find him”. When the Christians heard, they admired, saying, “The one who shouts loud is Qwǝrban and the shout is the glorification of Our Lady Mary, and his disappearance is because Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, keeps him and hides him from the eyes of killers”. This miracle that Our Lady Mary worked on the man was amazing to the Arami and exceedingly admirable to the Christians. May her prayer and blessing be with her maidservant Walatta Yohannǝs forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
