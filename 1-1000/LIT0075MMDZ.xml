            <abstract>
                <p>A young woman named Mary had a leather pouch containing twenty dinars’ worth of silver and gold. One day, after dining with her father, she dropped the pouch on the ground, and the family dog ate it. When she realized it was missing, she looked everywhere, but she couldn’t find it. So, she went to church and prayed for her namesake, the Virgin Mary, to return the pouch to her. Sometime later, the young woman’s mother dreamt that the Virgin Mary came to her and promised that the pouch would be found in due course. Around this same time, the dog that had eaten the pouch vomited it up in an out-of-the way place. Four months later, when she went out to clean up dog poop in the yard, the young woman found her pouch, miraculously intact and untouched.</p>

             <ab>This is a miracle [performed] by Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God. May her prayer and blessing be with us forever and ever. Amen.
This story is about a man’s daughter, whose name was Mary.1
She had twenty dinars of gold and silver, which she kept in a leather pouch [inside her clothes] upon her bosom.
She used to dine [with her father] all the time.
One day, after she dined at her father’s table, while she was returning to her home, the leather pouch fell.
Then, [the family] dog that ate crumbs from the banquet [found and] swallowed the leather pouch with the gold in it.
That night, when she was about to go to sleep, the woman checked her bosom and couldn’t find the [bag or the] gold.
She returned to her parents, wailing and crying.
When they heard her [story], they were very sad. So they looked for the leather pouch in the place where she had been sitting [at the table] and on the road she took [home], but they couldn’t find it.
In the morning, she went to church crying and asked the priests and the nuns to pray for her.
In their presence, she swore an oath to Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, saying, “My dear Lady, the wonder worker, if my gold is found due to your help, I will offer you incense and a ram.”2
She said this and then went home.
One night, after some time had passed, her mother had a dream.
In the dream, a majestic woman said to the mother, “Don’t be sad, for your daughter's possession will be found when the time is right.”3
The mother woke up and told her husband about her dream.
He replied, “Nothing is impossible for the Lord and his mother, Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God, the Mother of Mercy.”
Meanwhile, that [family] dog that we mentioned earlier went outside of the [father’s house] toward the compound fence, where nobody goes, and he vomited up the gold in its [intact] leather pouch.
After four months, when a young servant girl was collecting twigs [for fuel], she saw it.
Immediately, she screamed out, saying, “Come and see what I found in the dog's poop!”
The men and women in the compound ran to where the girl was and saw that daughter’s gold.
They marveled, saying to one another, “Had this been in a place where many people walk by, someone else would have [seen it and] taken it. All these things happened due to the help of Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God!”
The people who saw this miracle and heard about it glorified the Lord and praised Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, the Mother of God.
May her prayer and blessings be with her servant [person’s name omitted] forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
