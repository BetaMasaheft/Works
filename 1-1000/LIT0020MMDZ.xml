            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>In the country of Semrata Ab, there was a church devoted to Mary. Next to the church there stood a large tree that continued to widen until it became larger than the church. The clergymen were sad, as they were unsure how to solve the problem. If they cut the tree it would fall on the church, but if they did nothing it would eventually fall on the church regardless. The clergymen held rogation at vespers and prayed to Mary for help. When the they returned to the church the following day they found that the tree had miraculously been bent, such that it no longer endangered the church. The clergymen rejoiced that their church, Adnanita ʿOm, would survive.</p>

                <ab>A miracle which Our Lady Mary performed at a church built in her name in the [Ethiopian] region of Semrata Ab. 
                    The church’s precinct was very beautiful. Around the church there were trees, which looked like cedar branches. They looked like a built wall.
                    One of these trees widened and thickened a lot. The mass of its thickness was like a small house! Its height, too, became very tall; it became higher than the church [building].
                    Because of its excessive height, it leaned toward the church and was on the verge of crushing it.
                    When the clergy noticed this [problem], they rang the [church] bell, and the people of the country – men, women, the old and children – assembled.
                    They saw how the tree had leaned toward the church. They were really sad because the building of the church was so beautiful.
                    They said, “What should we do with it? If we cut it at the middle it will fall on the church and demolish it. But, we can't leave it either. For it is resting on [the church] and will eventually demolish it. We are troubled on all sides. [For now,] let's leave it [as is] and pray to the owner of the house [Mary] because everything is possible through her.”
                    They said this and held days of prayer and fasting[, especially] at evening prayer, with broken hearts and much weeping.
                    After they held these days of prayer and fasting, they said to Mary, “O mighty one, do what is best.”
                    They said this and returned to their [respective] homes.
                    And when the tender-hearted Our Lady Mary, Holy Twofold Virgin, Bearer of God, saw their great sorrow, that same night she turned [the tree] backward[, up off of the church]. Its top went out of the fence [and away from the church]. 
                    When day broke, people gathered to pray to her. But they found the tree had put its top outside the fence! They rejoiced with great joy.
                    They [re]named [the church] Our Lady Adhanita Om [Our Lady the Savior of the Tree]. Her church is called by this name up until today.
                    And everyone sees the tree that she leaned away [from the church] and admires this miracle.
                    May her prayer and blessing be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
