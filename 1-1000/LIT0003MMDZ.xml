                <p>A posthumous Miracle of Mary. In the country of Magdalo there was a church built in the name of Mary, and near this church there lived a woman named Mahdara Maryam. After many years of living there and devoting herself to Mary, Mahdara Maryam’s husband, who was the country’s ruler, moved her to compound sixty miles away from the church. Her husband went on a long military campaign, and while he was away he committed adultery. Mahdara Maryam heard about this and sent her husband a letter expressing her wish never to see him again. He obeyed her wish. Recognizing this woman as a chosen one, Mary sent a letter to Mahdara Maryam asking her to give up the house she had built in the compound. When the woman refused, Mary sent intercessors to ask on her behalf. When Mahdara Maryam refused again, Mary went herself to ask why she had denied her. Mahdara Maryam agreed to let Mary move in, but she wanted to know where she herself would live. Mary said she should live next door so that she could come to her church night and day.

                <ab>A miracle which Our Lady Mary worked in the country of Magdalo: Listen as we tell you! There was a church (in Magdalo) built in the name of Our Lady Mary. Near the church, there lived a woman whose name was Mahdara Maryam. The woman was a chosen and honored one in good deeds. She was truly a mahdara Maryam, because she loved (Mary) exceedingly and served her in everything she could. She did not interrupt going to church day or night to pray to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, for the salvation of her soul. She lived many years serving in church. After she lived many years near the church, her husband took her and moved her to another country far from the church whose distance was about 60 miles and placed her in a nice compound, because he was a ruler of the country (and could) do whatever he wanted. And his wife was a daughter of the nobility. So he placed her in a compound of his choice. After he settled her, he took a military expedition and tarried where he went. She built a tall and wide house of twin pinnacles. It was very nice; it was beautiful in its construction and foundation. Whoever saw it likened it to a church. When its construction and its fence were completed, the woman then moved in to live (in it). But her husband did not come back from where he went. He was very happy there because he had destroyed the Pagans and inherited their land. Therefore, he was very happy. Nevertheless, he was sad because it had been a while, more than ten years, since he had been separated from his wife. When his delay was too long, he slipped one day in the act of adultery. And the adulterous woman, who caused the man to fall, conceived. He had lived in abstention and no words of calumny had been heard about him before a day failed him. At that time, his wife heard that he had stumbled by a block of adultery. She sent him a missive, saying, “Do not show me your face after this, not to speak of us meeting in a way that a man and a woman do by being one body”. When he saw that the letter came from his wife, his heart burnt with the fire of sorrow, because he knew her mind, that she would not take back her word once it came out of her tongue. Therefore, his heart burnt with sorrow. He remained where he went, leaving all his children and his property because he knew her mind and that her dependence was on Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. As this chosen one was living in her house, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, sent her a missive, saying, “Give me your house that I may move in and live in it”. She sent many intercessors. But (the woman) refused, saying, “Where would I go?” She went on many years on this stand, and Our Lady Mary not giving up the (request) saying, “Give me your house”. The woman did not accept the words of the message. Finally, herself, Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, went (to the lady) at noon and found her at the threshold of her house. Our Lady Mary spoke to her with words of greetings. She was not wrathful because she was her beloved one. She knew her mind, that she was not a lover of money. She did not refuse any one of what one wanted, not to speak (of the request) of her Lady. She did not think about money, saying, “Let it be for me”. Rather, she gave it to anyone who was in need. If you ask me, “Then why did she refuse first when Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, sent a missive?” I, too, inform you, saying, “It was not to refuse (it) but to show the strength of her love to Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, when she went to her, and for this miracle to be revealed and every creature to hear it and admire, when they see the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God”. She begged her her house, making her the mistress although she was her maidservant. See the humility of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God! Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God! She is humble this much toward people, although her soul is in her hand, not to speak about her house. Let us go back to the subject which we had left. When Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, found the woman at the threshold of her house, she said to her, “Why did you deny me of your house when I sent (for it)?” The woman said to her, “Moving in, you may; but show me, too, (the house) where your good will is in which I should live”. Our Lady said to her, “Let your children be removed from my house about 10 mǝʿraf. But you, do not be far from the wall (of the church) so that you may come in to me day and night because I am attracted to you because of your love to me”. The two having made this counsel, Our Lady Mary moved into the house of the chosen one. The chosen one lived where Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God, showed her. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her maidservant Walatta Sara forever. Amen.  </ab>
