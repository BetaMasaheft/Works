            <abstract>
                <p>After a married couple, who used to keep the feasts of St Mary, become poor, the husband denies Christ and Mary and affirms 
                    Satan. Satan asks him to bring his wife, so that they will be given gold and silver. After the man states that his wife will not
                    come without seeing gold first, Satan tells him that a black dog will lead him to the gold and silver. The man finds the gold
                and brings it to his wife, telling her that it was given to him by a friend. As she remains dubious about the gold's rightful origin, he promises
                to take her to his friend. On the way, the wife wants to stop at a church, which the husband refuses to enter. She enters alone and prays
                before the icon of St Mary, under which she falls asleep. St Mary then appears to the husband under the aspect of his wife. He brings her to
                Satan who recognizes her and flees. After she reprimands him, he reaffirms his belief in her and is sent back to fetch his wife from the church.
                He repents and lives a righteous life.</p>
