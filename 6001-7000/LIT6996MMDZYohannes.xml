            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>Two years after Mary appointed Abbuna Yohannes, the abbot of Dabra Zamaddo, she informed him, through Abbuna Tatamqa Madhen, that he would go to Jerusalem. Before leaving on this journey, Abbuna Yohannes visited a pious woman named Salome in the country of Qebtya. He asked Salome to pray for Mary to guide him on his journey. Salome then went to speak with Mary about Abbuna Yohannes’s visit. Mary showed Salome a vision of Dabra Zamaddo, sister to Jerusalem and the most honored monastery of Ethiopia. Mary also told Salome the history of Dabra Zamaddo, including the eviction of Zamada Maryam as well as Abbuna Yohannes’s role in establishing the monastery.

                <ab>Listen! Let me tell you what Our Lady Mary did for Abuna Yohannǝs: When she summoned him from his country, she met him on the road looking like a poor woman. She also made him meet with Abuna Tatamqa Madhǝn who interpreted for him everything. And then she appointed him shepherd of her sheep. Two years after he was appointed, and the time came about when she told him in the mouth of Tatamqa Madhǝn, “Later you will go to Jerusalem”, grace stirred him and incited him. He sought someone who would ask God to straighten his journey for him, and Our Lady Mary that she may keep him from all evil. Since he was a humble person, he would not do what benefited himself. So he went to a certain woman who was God-fearing and a lover of Our Lady Mary, whose name was Salome, who lived in the country of Qǝbtya, and said to her, “Pray for me to Our Lady Mary that she may guide me and make me come to Jerusalem and return me in good health and in peace”. She said to him, “Alright” and prayed to Our Lady Mary. When she prayed to her, Our Lady Mary came and said to her, “What are you requesting from me?” And she said to her, “It is about Yohannǝs, the abbot of Zamaddo; for he wants to go to Jerusalem”. Our Lady Mary heard and answered her about another matter. She showed her a shining city, decorated with flowers and fruits. She showed her what she had not asked her (to show her). The woman said to Our Lady Mary, “Whose is (this) city which is honored with this much honor?” Our Lady said to her, “It belongs to Bartalomewos, the abbot of Zamaddo”. After she said this, (Our Lady Mary) followed with another matter. She started to tell her the glory of Dabra Zamaddo. She said to her, “Zamaddo is my tithe which my Son gave me; it is a sister of Jerusalem”. Because it is the sister of Jerusalem, you, too, O man, know that Dabra Zamaddo is more honored than the monasteries of Ethiopia which are called resting places of the righteous. For Jerusalem is honored more than the monasteries which are in the four corners of the world because it is the place of the incarnation of the Creator of the worlds. The end of his martyrdom, too, took place at it; his Sepulcher, too, is at it. And the memory of his Resurrection will be performed everywhere until the end of the world. And how would not Dabra Zamaddo be more honored than all the monasteries (of Ethiopia), if Our Lady testified about it, saying, “But Zamaddo is my tithe and a sister of Jerusalem”? You, too, do know and comprehend that tithe is God’s property, and is honored more than all properties of the world. A sister is beloved to her sister. Therefore, we say, “Dabra Zamaddo is (highly) honored, also because it is called a tithe of Our Lady Mary”. Furthermore, let us go back to the subject which we left before, about which you said to me “The house belonged to Zamada Maryam”. You should not think that the house belonged to a worldly woman but that it is the house of the Lady of all of us. Regarding what I told you in the previous section, “You will find it later”, behold, I have told you (now) that it is the house of Our Lady Mary and her tithe which her Son has given her. And you, if you say to me, “Then why did the woman occupy the house of Our Lady Mary (in the first place)?” I will tell you, saying, “Because she was called by the name of Our Lady Mary”. But if you say to me, “Why did she evict her?” I, too, will say to you, “She has no guilt if she evicts her from her (own) house, and (Mary), the owner of the house, occupied (it)”. Furthermore, let me inform you, saying to you, “At at the be[ginning …” Behold,] we have told you our research on how the construction of Dabra Zamaddo was started in the hands of Abuna Yohannǝs – its beginning and (later) its end. May the prayer and blessing of Our Lady Mary and the grace of Abuna Yohannǝs keep us from the host of the serpent, together with Abuna Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen</ab>
