            <creation>The earliest <ref target="https://pemm.princeton.edu/">PEMM</ref> manuscript in which this story appears is from around 1900. Originally composed in <placeName ref="LOC6431Zammad">Dabra Zamaddo</placeName></creation>
            <abstract>
                <p>A widow named Zamada Maryam lived alone with her children at Dabra Zamaddo. The grotto where this building stood belonged to Mary, who had received it as a tithe from her son. Mary wanted the grotto back, so she decided to evict Zamada Maryam and her children. To this end she influenced a monk named Bartalomewos, who was traveling from his home in Metsraha to Jerusalem. Sending the archangels Michael and Gabriel along as guides, Mary redirected Bartalomewos to Dabra Zamaddo. When Bartalomewos arrived and instructed Zamada Maryam to vacate the premises, the woman refused. The monk informed Mary of the woman’s refusal. That night, while the woman and her children slept, Mary conducted them and all their possessions through the air, setting them down gently in a field called Marheba Si'ol. When Zamada Maryam awoke, she stood up and returned to the grotto to discover what was going on. There she saw Bartalomewos with Mary’s tabot, standing before a wooden curtain. Dabra Zamaddo was also filled with doves, a sight that amazed Zamada Maryam. The story concludes with a warning for the reader not to judge Mary for evicting the woman.

                    <ab>A miracle of Our Holy Lady, Virgin in two ways, Mary, Bearer of God. May her prayer and blessing and the mercy of her beloved Son be with her servant Gabra Maryam forever and ever. Amen. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Listen to this, our fathers and brothers! Let us tell you the story of the miracle of Our Lady Mary which she worked at Dabra Zamaddo in the rock grotto. A certain woman, whose husband was dead, had lived in it with her many possessions and many children. The name of the woman was Zamada Maryam. But the courtyard she occupied belonged to Our Lady that her Son, Our Lord, had given her, saying, “Let it be your tithe”. When the time came for the owner of the house to move in to live (in it), she decided to evict the woman. (So) she stirred up a certain God-fearing monk from an island in the west called Mǝtsraha. The name of the monk was Bartalomewos. He never had that place in mind. Rather, he set out (from Mǝtsraha) to go to Jerusalem. But our Lady turned him to the direction of her house and brought him, with the two exalted and honored angels, Michael and Gabriel, guiding him. They came to the woman and begged her, saying, “Vacate this place for us so that we may place (in it) the tabot of Our Lady”. She replied to them, saying to them, “Where should I go? What shall become of me? I have no other house. And it is impossible for me to build a house. Furthermore, my children are young, and my household materials that God gave me are many”. She said this and refused their request. And the saints went back. For Our Lady’s custom is like that of a child who gives and begs whatever it is. Although she knew (the woman’s) thinking, nevertheless she sent messengers to teach us, the arrogant ones, the path of humility. In regards to the woman, she did not requite her with requital due to misers when she saw her stubborn mind. Rather, on that very night, she lifted her up with her children and all her possessions – without a shred of grass or a broken piece of glass falling – took her far away and placed her in a field called Marhǝba Si’ol because of the severity of the cold and frost that come down upon it. When she woke up from her sleep, she was shocked and trembled. But Our Lady did not cause her to be shocked nor to fear. She rather placed her well. At that time, the woman stood up and went to her former courtyard so that she could know what was going on. When she arrived, she found Abuna Bartalomewos with the tabot of Our Lady Mary, having installed a wooden curtain. She admired this and was amazed; she had no word with which to react. In regards to our father, he lived happily, serving (Mary) with good service. And many doves, who were born from him and who took refuge with Our Lady Mary, filled it. Now let us go back to the subject which we had left. Please, do not agree, O man, when a critique criticizes, saying, “Why did she take away her courtyard without her consent?” Please, do not rush to judge, O man, against Our Lady before you know its mystery. For Our Lady does not abolish a law but makes laws; and she does not take forcibly others’ possessions. Let not your heart think that she took it from (the woman) forcibly. Rather, Our Lady was the first (to own) the courtyard, as she had received it from her Son. And you, the skeptic, will find (this fact) in another section, if you are not impatient. Abuna Bartalomewos finished his time in toil and exhaustion, as the power of Our Lady helped him. May her prayer and blessing keep us and help us finish (our time) in good health and peace forever and ever. Amen.</ab>
